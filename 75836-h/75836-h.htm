FOREWORD

<p>
The fact that I belong to a family genealogically
resembling the Greene family suggested
to me the scheme of this book.
</p>

<p>
Apart from this similarity all the characters
in "Six Mrs. Greenes" are entirely fictional.

MRS. GREENE
</h3>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Old Mrs. Greene was very tired.
</p>

<p>
When she was tired she talked to herself, and
her talk was a jumble of names.  Her sons, her
grandsons, her granddaughter, her granddaughter's
husband, jigged about in her brain.
They formed groups, advanced towards her in
a solid phalanx, broke up and receded again.
The pattern of their comings and goings was
shot with pleasure at some remembered incident,
or again with intense irritation that found
vent in mumbled phrases.  "She's always been a
stupid woman."
</p>

<p>
"What did you say, Mrs. Greene?" asked
Miss Dorset, a quiet, pleasant young woman
who acted as her housekeeper and companion.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't," said Mrs. Greene, annoyed at
being interrupted in that restless uncontrollable
reverie which was all that remained to her of
thought, but the innumerable little lines on her
old cheeks smoothed into tranquillity as a
sudden recollection of her granddaughter's last
visit established itself momentarily in her mind.
Lavinia had been very sweet and so pretty.  That
scarlet frock had seemed to darken her eyes and
whiten her skin; even her hair shone as she sat on
a footstool after dinner in front of the fire, her
hands clasped round her knees, and talked about
Martin endlessly, glowingly; about the two
Martins, her husband and her son.  A happy child
Lavinia; Martin, a satisfactory grandson-in-law,
and Martin, the little great-grandson, a pleasant
thing to think about.  Why was it that Lavinia's
husband had not been able to come for the week-end
with Lavinia?  Mrs. Greene groped in her
mind for the reason and then stumbled on it
suddenly as one of the things Lavinia had spoken
about with pride.  Martin had been asked to go
North to represent the firm on business.  He had
to interview two clients and persuade them to
carry through an important deal, and it was a
matter for congratulation that the negotiations
had been entrusted to him.
</p>

<p>
Old Mrs. Greene pondered.  The beginnings
of life, how terrible they were; each action,
even the most impulsive and ill-considered,
marching steadily on towards its inevitable
result, and eliminating logically the possibility of
any other result.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, looking back, she saw her life
move down its long determined track, marked
erratically here and there by emotions, incidents
and circumstances: her passionate love for
Geoffrey, her husband; her passionate maternal love
for Rodney and Edwin; the death of her father;
her sons' marriages; her husband's sudden and
widespread literary recognition; Edwin's death,
and then her husband's death followed
immediately by the birth of Lavinia's son, her only
great-grandchild.  She looked down at her thin
old hands with the loose rings slipping up the
fingers, and thought with clear lucidity: what
changes are wrought by the alchemy of years
in this poor human stuff.
</p>

<p>
Immediately her age, her weariness, her
thousand bodily discomforts, crowded into the
present and engulfed the past.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Dorset," she said querulously, "help
me to bed, Miss Dorset, I'm tired."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
When a hen's life is ended by the chopper the
severed head falls to the ground, but the body
with spattered wings awkwardly outstretched
steps erratically this way and that, watched from
the ground by its own surprised eyes until its
ultimate surrender to the laws of death and
gravity.
</p>

<p>
Miss Dorset fifteen years ago had suffered
and lived through a kindred mutilation, being
forced to watch from the edge of a cliff her
twin sister and only relative drowning a
hundred yards from the shore.  Mary Dorset had
gone bathing, Clara Dorset had gone walking.
Mary took cramp, struggled a little, and sank,
while Clara on the top of the cliff darted a few
steps to the right, a few to the left, screaming,
and finally fell to the ground, overborne by the
shocking realisation of her loss and of her utter
impotence to have prevented it.
</p>

<p>
Since then Miss Dorset, always competent,
always adequate, had been curiously incomplete.
An√¶sthetized by this early tragedy she
was invulnerable to further suffering, impervious
to the pinpricks of poverty and dependence,
and utterly unmoved in the face of any
difficulty or crisis.  Sometimes at night between
waking and sleeping, or in the early morning
between sleeping and waking, she was stabbed
by a poignant vision of that scene of fifteen years
ago, but no trace of emotion showed, as a rule,
in her quiet manner of life.
</p>

<p>
She had lived with Mrs. Greene for seven
years, at first as housekeeper and secretary.
Since Mr. Greene's death, however, which had
occurred suddenly three years ago, her role had
been much more comprehensive.  She managed
the household, prepared for visitors, welcoming
them unobtrusively on their arrival, and
discreetly beckoning one guest out as she
shepherded another in, lest the fatigue of prolonged
conversation should lead to a restless night for
the old lady.  But she was also Mrs. Greene's
constant companion, on her walks, in the house
and at meals; there were indeed few moments
in the day when she could contrive to be alone.
</p>

<p>
The measured routine of life was rarely
broken in its succession of small daily services
and arrangements, but when any of the grandchildren
came for a visit Miss Dorset showed a
natural grace not only in her methods of
self-effacement but in leaving undone those trivial
duties which, carried out by Geoffrey, Lavinia
or Hugh, became a source of pleasure to
Mrs. Greene.  "Give me a cushion, Geoffrey, and
arrange my shawl," she would say; and when
Geoffrey had fumbled the cushion into place
Miss Dorset, fully conscious of the fact that he
had not added to Mrs. Greene's comfort, nevertheless
appreciated the pleasure that it had given
her to be waited on by her grandson.
</p>

<p>
There was a genuinely comfortable relationship
between Mrs. Greene and Miss Dorset:
Mrs. Greene seldom resented the fact of her
physical dependence on Miss Dorset, and Miss
Dorset understood, too well to be wounded by
any sharpness of tongue, the old woman's
kindliness, sagacity and clear sightedness.
</p>

<p>
At 9.15 every morning Miss Dorset brought
up the letters, and waited quietly by the bedside,
watching the unsteady fingers tearing open the
envelopes and slowly withdrawing the rustling
sheets.  It would have been easy to offer help,
but Miss Dorset was infinitely patient.
"Mrs. Greene likes to do little things for herself,"
she would explain.  "It takes a few moments
longer, but she has a great deal of leisure, you
know."  And Helen&mdash;it was generally Helen who
expostulated at delay, and was ready with her
facile, "Let me do it, Granny,"&mdash;must needs
restrain herself and watch the number of laborious
trembling movements that were necessary
to perform any simple action.
</p>

<p>
This morning Miss Dorset remembering
Mrs. Greene's extreme fatigue on the previous
night, looked anxiously at her face as she took
the letters, but made no comment.  Mrs. Greene,
however, answered the unspoken question, "I
had a good night, thank you, and I'm not tired
to-day."
</p>

<p>
She laid a hand on Miss Dorset's arm and
added: "You're a nice restful creature to have
about."
</p>

<p>
A deep, unbecoming flush spread over Miss
Dorset's sallowness at the unusual tribute, but
she only said quietly: "Thank you, I'm very
happy here with you," and then waited with
folded hands for any news or instructions to be
imparted to her.
</p>

<p>
It was a long time before Mrs. Greene leaned
back on her pillow and allowed a neat and
closely written letter to slip from her fingers
on to the bed.  She was worrying.  A thousand
tiny lines creased her forehead, and she pushed
back her scanty white hair with a gesture
reminiscent of the days when heavy dark wings
smooth and shining like Lavinia's, had swept
down from her middle parting to cover the ears
that now jutted out like excrescences on her
shrunken skull.
</p>

<p>
"It's not a good idea," she said with an
unusual tremor in her voice.  "It's a sentimental
idea and the children don't hold with sentiment
and anniversaries and such like, and it will be
very difficult for me.  In fact if Edith weren't
so set on it, I wouldn't think of going, but you
know how my daughter-in-law must always
have her way."
</p>

<p>
"Is it a letter from Mrs. Rodney that is
worrying you?" asked Miss Dorset.
</p>

<p>
"I told you it was," answered Mrs. Greene.
"Here, you'd better read it."
</p>

<p>
She picked up the letter and handed it to Miss
Dorset.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
  207, Sussex Square.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nov. 9th.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
My dear Mrs. Greene,
</p>

<p>
Rodney and I were delighted to hear from
Lavinia that you were so well and in such
good spirits when she saw you at the
weekend.  We have been hoping to come and see
you for the last few weeks, but Rodney has
been very busy, and I have had a great deal on
my hands since the wedding.  I've been supervising
Hugh's and Jessica's house being got
ready for them among other things.  They come
home on Tuesday evidently very happy, and
quite sure that no couple ever had a honeymoon
like theirs.  I have a little plan for
them which I do hope you will try and fall
in with, as it will be no good at all without
you.  Aunt Sarah is to be in town next week
I hear, staying with her own relations, and I
think it would be such a good idea if you
would come up for one night for a little
dinner party.  Just the family of course.
</p>

<p>
Do you realise that there are now six
Mrs. Greenes?  You and Aunt Sarah, Dora and
myself, and the two children, Helen and
Jessica.  I think Friday week would be best.
Rodney will come himself to fetch you in the
car, and you can have a long rest before
dinner, and motor home on Saturday.  Now
don't say no, I have really set my heart on
having a reunion of the three generations.
</p>

<p>
Rodney sends his love and is hoping to see
you.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Much love from<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDITH.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Miss Dorset read this through carefully,
reflected for a moment and then said decisively:
"I don't think it would be wise for you to go,
Mrs. Greene; you've been very easily tired the
last few weeks, and this time of year is trying.
Will you not dictate a letter for Mrs. Rodney
saying you don't feel able to accept her invitation?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't call that an invitation," said Mrs.
Greene forcibly.  "More like a command.  My
daughter-in-law arranges everything for
everybody and sends them their instructions."
</p>

<p>
Her voice lost its vibration and dropped on a
flat note as she added: "It's easier to fall in with
her plans, than to hold out against them; I'm
getting old.  And perhaps it will please Rodney
to have me in his house again, though it's more
hers than his."
</p>

<p>
A long silence fell.  Miss Dorset had no
comment to offer and Mrs. Greene was obviously
immersed in painful thoughts.  Suddenly she
roused herself and leaned forward, speaking
with such calmness and certainty that her words
borrowed the force of oratory.
</p>

<p>
"When a woman has lived with her husband
and loved her husband for over fifty years, she
shouldn't live on after him.  She's only a cripple.
There's no place left for her, and no power.  I
saw one of my sons marry a girl I didn't like,
and the other a girl I despised.  I lost Edwin in
the War, and Edwin's son soon after.  Geoffrey
and I were old; we were on the shelf, but we
still had our place in life.  Now Geoffrey's dead
and I'm lost.  I'm Granny and Greatgranny;
I'm an old woman to be humoured and treated
kindly and encouraged and taken here and there
for her own good, but I'm not Mrs. Geoffrey
Greene.  She's dead."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene had spoken with long pauses
between the sentences.  When she had finished
she closed her eyes and sat upright and motionless,
drained of colour, teeth and hair assailed
by the greedy years, but with the lovely
structure of jaw and cheekbone more visible under
the sagging skin than it had ever been under
firm flesh.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you should let Mrs. Rodney's
letter depress you," hazarded Miss Dorset at
last.  "If you decide to go I know both she and
Mr. Rodney will make all arrangements for
your comfort."
</p>

<p>
"Everybody makes arrangements for my
comfort," said Mrs. Greene harshly.  "And nobody
can achieve it for me."
</p>

<p>
She spoke with her eyes still shut, and there
was bitter resignation in the line of her mouth.
</p>

<p>
"We do try," ventured Miss Dorset gently.
At the sound of her troubled voice Mrs. Greene
lifted her lids and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I know you do," she said, and her voice had
regained its ring.  "I'm an ungrateful,
cantankerous old woman, and I may last like this for
years."
</p>

<p>
The crudity of the last sentence was the signal
for Miss Dorset to change the subject.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to get up now?" she asked.
"You have a nice full day before you: it's so
sunny this morning that I think a little walk
will do you good, and then you remember
Mrs. Hugh is coming for to-night on her way up to
town.  She arrives at 4.15, and I've ordered the
car to meet her."
</p>

<p>
"I'd forgotten Sarah was coming to-day,"
said Mrs. Greene.  "I'll be glad to see her.  I
wonder if she has heard from Edith; she'll be
no more pleased than I am about this ridiculous
party."
</p>

<p>
All her good humour came back at the malicious
and delightful thought of imparting the
unwelcome news to her sister-in-law and
discussing with her the unreasonableness of such a
plan.
</p>

<p>
"Sarah will see that it's a bad idea," she
repeated confidently.  "There'll we be, three widows
and three wives, each of us supposed to stand
for something, and the whole idea quite false.
I'm not an old Greene grandmother any more
than Edith is a Greene mother and Jessica a
young Greene wife; I'm Margaret Hill, and
Jessica is Jessica Deane, and we married men of
the same name and the same blood, but nobody
but Edith would ever expect that to link us up in
a chain."
</p>

<p>
"I know you will enjoy a talk with Mrs. Hugh,"
said Miss Dorset.  "Shall I put her in
the usual room, or do you think she likes the
view from the front better?  It isn't such a good
room, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Put her in the front room.  Sarah is like me;
she likes to look out on a good view and a wide
space, and so long as the bed is comfortable she
won't notice anything else.  And now help me
up, please."
</p>

<p>
The business of getting Mrs. Greene dressed
for the day was exhausting both for her and for
Miss Dorset, but there were few days in
the year when her indomitable courage and
vitality allowed her to lie abed and forgo the
effort for twenty-four hours.  The irritation
involved in thrusting out each leg to have its
stocking drawn on was so intense as to amount
to pain; her back ached and her skin tingled.
It was infinite weariness to get her arms into
her sleeves and keep her head steady to have
her hair done, but Mrs. Greene faced these
ordeals with fortitude and equanimity.
</p>

<p>
Every morning the indignity of physical
helplessness struck her afresh, but every morning
she banished the thought with resolution and
ignored in conversation the difficulties of her
toilet.  Her good humour never failed her here,
and Miss Dorset was too well versed in the
intricacies of her employer's code of reticence
ever to provoke her by an allusion to the matter
in hand.
</p>

<p>
Usually during that painful three quarters of
an hour they discussed the news of the day which
both had absorbed during breakfast, Mrs. Greene
with genuine interest in current activities,
Miss Dorset uninterested, except in so far
as they provided a topic of discussion attractive
to Mrs. Greene.  Mrs. Rodney's letter,
however, altered the trend of Mrs. Greene's
conversation for this one morning.
</p>

<p>
"What dress have I got to wear at my
daughter-in-law's dinner?" she asked crisply.
"I won't wear black and I think my grey satin
is getting shabby."
</p>

<p>
"I think perhaps it is a little," agreed Miss
Dorset.  "But it always looks very nice."
</p>

<p>
"Shabby and nice don't go together," was the
uncompromising reply.  "We'll write to Madame
Fenella to-day and ask her to send down a fitter
with some patterns of grey satin and brocade.
I'll wear my diamond necklace, and grey is a
good background.  You know, Miss Dorset, I've
always liked nice dresses."
</p>

<p>
"I know you have, Mrs. Greene; all your
things have been beautiful as long as I've known
you."
</p>

<p>
"But it was before you knew me that I had
my best things," said Mrs. Greene staring into
the mirror, but not seeing the face ragged with
age reflected in it.  Seeing herself instead forty,
fifty and sixty years ago when she was ardent
and lovely.
</p>

<p>
"There was a sea-green poplin," she said
dreamily.  "A silk poplin that Geoffrey liked
very much.  That was the summer when Edwin
was ten; I remember going up in it to kiss him
good-night.  And before that there was a blue
velvet, peacock blue we called it, with a tight
bodice and a flounced skirt all drawn to the back.
But when I was a girl, before I married, it was
always white.  I remember asking my mother
for a red evening dress but she wouldn't hear
of it, so I didn't get one till long after I
married&mdash;and then it didn't suit me."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene smiled, thinking of the red
dress that had been a failure, and then went on
musingly:
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why it didn't suit me; Lavinia
is very like what I was at her age, and she looks
so pretty in red; but Godfrey liked me best in
green and blue, and I used to dress to please
him."
</p>

<p>
"I think you always look very nice in grey,
and of course, as you say, it's a lovely
background for your jewels," said Miss Dorset,
whose sole conversational aim was to direct
Mrs. Greene down pleasant paths and by-ways and
prevent if possible any comparison between the
empty present and the rich past.
</p>

<p>
On this occasion she was fortunate.  An
expression of real pleasure lit up Mrs. Greene's
faded eyes.  She spoke with assurance.
</p>

<p>
"You know, Miss Dorset, it's a long time
since I wore my diamond necklace; in fact it's a
long time since I went over my jewels at all.  I
think with the party coming off I'd really better
look through them."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure it would be a good plan," agreed
Miss Dorset.
</p>

<p>
"Very well then, we'll go out now; I'm ready
am I not?  And this afternoon you'll open the
safe and I'll go over all my things.  Geoffrey did
love to give me jewels.  You know I used to be
very dark, and he always thought them very
becoming to me."
</p>

<p>
"You'll be quite busy then," said Miss
Dorset, relieved to think that the day promised
to be a full and interesting one for Mrs. Greene;
for once in a way there was a definite little plan
for each of the yawning intervals between
meals.
</p>

<p>
To Miss Dorset each day presented itself as
a problem in four sections: in each section some
trivial interest or occupation had to be provided
for old Mrs. Greene, whose mental outlook,
through still vivid, could not avoid being
impinged upon by her physical limitations.  There
was the long interval between getting dressed
and lunch time which could only be comfortably
filled by a walk.  Miss Dorset registered an
aggrieved resentment against Providence for
any lapse from fine weather conditions between
11 a.m. and 1 p.m.  Subconsciously she felt that
it was Mrs. Greene's prerogative to enjoy the
sun for these two hours.
</p>

<p>
The shorter interval between lunch and tea
was partially filled by a rest, and often by
preparations for some visitor who was coming to
tea, and whose visit involved for her punctilious
hostess a change of dress and shawl.
</p>

<p>
The hour after tea was often a difficult and
irritable time, particularly in winter when the
heavy curtains had to be drawn early and
Mrs. Greene could not sit at her drawing-room
window, gazing over the fields to the little larch
wood that darkened and thickened as light faded
out of the sky, and then magically thinned
again till each twig was separate and visible in
the clear darkness.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes there was a library list to be made,
or a parcel of library books to be opened, and to
Miss Dorset at least, it was a matter of signal
importance that the second post arrived at
5 o'clock.  It might contain letters that would
keep Mrs. Greene occupied for half an
hour.
</p>

<p>
There was always Patience, of course, but
there were few days when this proved to be
anything but a dreary makeshift.  Mrs. Greene
would lay out the cards, idly pick up the kings
and queens, turn them about as if the designs
were new to her and forget what Patience she
had embarked on.  Even Miss Dorset's nervous
system was not proof against the strain of
watching her try to play "Monte Carlo" with cards
arranged for "Demon."
</p>

<p>
After dinner was a blessedly short period,
and generally a happy one.
</p>

<p>
Summer and winter alike Mrs. Greene would
come through from the dining-room in a mood
of tranquil acquiescence; content either to dream
by the open window with the scent of stocks
from the flower beds and hay from the meadows
beyond, blowing in on the cool night breeze, or
else to sit in front of the fire gazing at the
glowing logs which helped her to focus her mind and
recapture elusive memories.
</p>

<p>
On this November day each section had provided
its own solution.
</p>

<p>
"I think perhaps you should put on something
warm," said Miss Dorset, avoiding
instinctively any suggestion that she was dictator
rather than adviser in the matter of wraps.  "It's
a lovely sunny day but there's a cold wind
blowing round the corner of the house."
</p>

<p>
She arranged Mrs. Greene's heavy cape as she
spoke, and then gently took her arm as they
began the laborious descent of the stairs.
</p>

<p>
This safely accomplished and the old lady
deposited for a moment on a chair in the hall,
Miss Dorset hurried off to fetch her own coat.
</p>

<p>
"There now, we're all ready," she stated
cheerfully on her return.  "Will you have your
walking-stick?"
</p>

<p>
She handed it to Mrs. Greene and they set
off, walking slowly towards the walled garden,
where clumps of tattered Michaelmas daisies,
some limp and shabby chrysanthemums, and a
few stalwart dahlias still defied the coming
winter.
</p>

<p>
A sudden jocose gust of wind swept the
leaves along the untidy earthen borders, whirled
under Mrs. Greene's cape, and set all the
branches rustling and all the tree tops tossing
madly.
</p>

<p>
"You're sure this isn't too much for you?"
asked Miss Dorset anxiously.
</p>

<p>
Everything was in motion; trees, bushes, and
tatterdemalion flower heads.  Even the earth
seemed to move under the restless scattering
leaves.
</p>

<p>
"I like it," she announced stoutly, and
breathed deep of the rich odour of decay that
rose like a miasma from the ground.  "I like
autumn; it's the time for adventures and fine
deeds; it's the bravest season of all."
</p>

<p>
"That's quite true; I should like to die in the
autumn."
</p>

<p>
Miss Dorset's answer was as totally
unexpected as was the intensity with which she
spoke.  Mrs. Greene looked at her for a
moment.
</p>

<p>
"You're still young," she said.  "Death isn't
the only adventure left for you as it is for me.
You ought to like spring best, when the
celandines come out."
</p>

<p>
Miss Dorset relapsed into her usual quiet
apologetic manner, so strangely at variance
with the uncompromising ferocity of her sentiments.
</p>

<p>
"Spring always seems to me a little silly,"
she asserted.  "It's all so hopeful and promising,
and hope and promise are such callow things
and fall so soon in ruins."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly realising that she had broken one
of her inviolable rules in betraying so intimate
a glimpse of her personality, Miss Dorset
hastily turned into a less personal channel.
</p>

<p>
"I think the word 'jejune' expresses what I
feel about spring, but, as you say, the autumn is
a fine season, and to-day is really beautiful."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene held her peace.  She had always
possessed too much sensibility to frustrate
anyone's means of escape from a conversational
predicament.  She had never pressed for a
confidence.  But as they walked down the path and
out at the further gate from garden to wood it
struck her as strange that there should be this
kinship of thought between Miss Dorset and her.
</p>

<p>
The inequalities of life are very marked, she
thought.  Most of us arrive at the same conclusion,
but the ways in which we reach it are as
many as the leaves scuttling at my feet.  I lived
for seventy-five good years, then Geoffrey died
and the lean years came.  All that was left was
to do the best I could from day to day, trying to
be a little stoical, and not getting too whining
and senile.  But here's this poor dried-up
creature.  She never had a spring time and yet she
lives like me from day to day getting a little
pleasure here and a little comfort there, but
really only living towards the grave.
</p>

<p>
Her heart stirred with pity as she thought of
the glowing human relationships that had been
her happiness and delight for seventy-five
years, contrasted with the absolute emptiness of
Miss Dorset's thirty-eight years.
</p>

<p>
"The trouble is I've lived too long; three
years too long; but she's never lived at all."
</p>

<p>
Inadvertently she spoke aloud, but Miss
Dorset was quite unaware of the trend of
thought that had led to the remark.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," she said mechanically,
more as a warning to her employer that she was
thinking aloud, than in expectation of a reply.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene, however, answered abruptly:
</p>

<p>
"There's a ruby and diamond brooch in the
safe that I'm going to give you when we go
through my things this afternoon.  I meant
to leave it to you anyhow, but you might
as well have it now.  I'd like to see you
wearing it."
</p>

<p>
She hardly heard Miss Dorset's surprised and
nervous thanks.  She was again lost in thought,
appreciating with painful clearness her motive
in making this impulsive gesture.  Life had
given nothing to Clara Dorset, so she, Margaret
Greene, was giving her a diamond and ruby
brooch.  It seemed somehow inadequate;
Mrs. Greene smiled at the thought of how inadequate
it was, but she sighed sharply at the tragic
futility of all human endeavours to compensate,
to strike a balance between loss and gain.
</p>

<p>
The day had changed for her.  The fitful
kindly wind was no longer kindly.  It tugged at
her hat and made her bones ache cruelly.  The
white clouds blowing across the sky seemed
harbingers of rain, threatening to overcast the sun.
She felt frail and impotent, and when she said,
"I should like to turn back now," there was a
quaver in her voice that she tried in vain to
conceal.
</p>

<p>
As they retraced their slow steps Miss Dorset
recited in detail her preparations for
Mrs. Hugh's arrival.
</p>

<p>
"I've put two big vases of leaves in her
bedroom," she said.  "There really aren't any
flowers left worth picking and the leaves are a
beautiful colour."
</p>

<p>
"Sarah's garden at Lynton will be full of
flowers.  They bloom for her all the year round,
but I'm no gardener."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene was regaining her serenity.
</p>

<p>
"What are we giving her for dinner?" she
asked.  "Sarah pays no attention to what she
eats, but I'd like to give her such a good dinner
that she'll be bound to notice it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I had thought of a good clear soup,
some stuffed fillets of sole, a pheasant, and a nice
apricot cream," said Miss Dorset tentatively,
"but that can easily be changed if you would like
something more elaborate."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like elaborate things," answered
Mrs. Greene, "but Sarah never thinks of anything
so mundane as food and it's good for her
to meet a materialist like me."
</p>

<p>
She reflected for a moment and then
pronounced decisively.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's a good dinner.  But not apricot
cream.  Tell cook to make a peach tart with our
own bottled peaches, and to give us a good hot
savoury after it, and tell her to put enough
sherry in the soup.  I don't know why, but when
there's no man to cook for, they won't put
sherry in the soup or rum in the trifles."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene spoke energetically.  Careless
herself as to what she ate, she had always held
it important not only that her glass and silver
should be beyond reproach, but that the food
served to guests should be delicately chosen and
delicately cooked.
</p>

<p>
"There's a lot to be learnt from food," she
continued in a ruminating vein.  "Take Sarah,
for instance.  After a dinner at Lynton you can't
help knowing she's a good gardener because of
her fruit and vegetables, but you can't help
seeing she isn't discriminating; she gives you
nourishment without quality.  And think of
Edith.  Every meal I've eaten in that house has
stamped her afresh as a practical, unimaginative,
uninteresting woman."
</p>

<p>
"I hadn't really thought of it, but I'm sure
there's a lot in what you say," agreed Miss
Dorset.  "Here we are back again.  Shall we go in
now or would you like another little turn?"
</p>

<p>
"I would not," Mrs. Greene replied crisply.
"I'll go in and warm myself till lunch time; this
wind chills my bones."
</p>

<p>
The warm atmosphere of the house after the
tang of the fresh November air brought a gentle
consciousness of fatigue that did not dissipate
during lunch time, and Mrs. Greene was not
reluctant to go upstairs for her afternoon rest.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the indignity of returning to the
habits of childhood struck deep into her soul;
occasionally she indulged in a rare petulance,
but generally she accepted philosophically the
restrictions of her narrow life.
</p>

<p>
"You understand what I want you to do,
don't you?" she asked Miss Dorset on the way
up to her room.  "Open the safe, and get out all
the leather cases, and take down my jewel case
from my bedroom and put everything ready for
me in the library."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, I'll see to that," answered Miss
Dorset; and with the anticipation of a pleasant
task to be performed when she awoke, Mrs. Greene
fell asleep.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
When the time came to waken Mrs. Greene
lest a prolonged sleep should spoil her night's
rest, Miss Dorset experienced a tremor of the
heart looking at the old face on the pillow.
</p>

<p>
She perceived more clearly than anyone the
ravages wrought by the three years since
Geoffrey Greene's death in the body that encased
Margaret Greene's ardent but flickering vitality.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it was impossible to believe that
Mrs. Greene was only sleeping; her face seemed
too old, too small, too hollow of cheek and
temple, ever to waken to a semblance of life.
These stiff brittle-looking eyelids could surely
never lift again, the body outstretched under the
eiderdown in a rigid and comfortless abandon
could never reassemble itself into the familiar
contours of trunk and limbs.  Miss Dorset
endured a moment's prevision of the inevitable
day when she would touch a hand and find it
cold; every day she flinched at the thought, but
every day she marshalled her resources and
bent down to Mrs. Greene with the invariable
remark:
</p>

<p>
"I think perhaps you would like to waken
now, and get up."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene wakened slowly and with difficulty.
Her first consciousness was of the past.
She wakened in the period of her early marriage
when her children were young&mdash;often with
their names on her lips&mdash;and she would look
vacantly at Miss Dorset for a few moments
while her brain went roaming down the long
years past the familiar landmarks of marriages,
births and deaths, till it fetched up at last with
a consciousness of her present situation, recognition
of Miss Dorset, and with a final detailed
knowledge of the month, the day, and her
immediate plans.
</p>

<p>
Even so, for a little while her conversation
was disjointed; she referred to her grandchildren
by her children's names, and it seemed
a cruelty to expect her to re-assume the burden
of rational thought.
</p>

<p>
To-day the struggle was not so prolonged as
usual.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I would like to get up now," she said,
still lying motionless but collecting her forces
for the effort.  "Edith will be here soon and I
mustn't be late for tea."
</p>

<p>
"It's Mrs. Hugh who is coming, not Mrs.
Rodney," Miss Dorset corrected gently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, I know it is; that's what I said,"
replied Mrs. Greene testily.  "Get me up now.
I'll put on my good blue dress and the shawl
Lavinia gave me."
</p>

<p>
Changing in the afternoon was a much
simpler matter than dressing in the morning.
Some of the troubled vagueness and docility of
interrupted sleep still hung about Mrs. Greene,
and she hardly noticed that her body was being
turned this way and that, her hair brushed, and
her frock fastened.
</p>

<p>
"Everything is ready for you if you still feel
you would like to go over your jewels,"
suggested Miss Dorset on the way downstairs.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I would; I hadn't forgotten,"
snapped Mrs. Greene, whose irritability
proclaimed clearly that she had forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Miss Dorset opened the library door and
disclosed the thin November sunlight streaming
over the open cases laid out on the table, setting
the diamonds a-glitter and shining into the
heart of rubies and sapphires.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene stopped in the doorway and
drew a quick breath of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"They look very fine," she said excitedly,
"I didn't know I had so much.  Of course there
are some of my mother's jewels there, as well
as Geoffrey's mother's, and all the things he
gave me."
</p>

<p>
She moved over to the table and sat down,
lifting up her diamond necklace and pendant to
pore over its intricate but austere design.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't this beautiful?" she asked, not waiting
for an answer.  "Geoffrey gave it me after his
first very successful book.  We took a house in
the country so that he could be free to finish it
without interruptions, and he wrote all the
summer.  It was a lovely summer too, although
Edwin's engagement in the autumn upset us all
rather.  We didn't think it very wise.  However,
Mr. Greene got his book finished, and it came
out in November and was very successful indeed,
and this is what he gave me the Christmas after.
I remember thinking it was terribly extravagant
of him, but of course I didn't know then that
his book would go so well in America."
</p>

<p>
"It is a wonderful necklace," said Miss
Dorset, holding it up to the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's not the way to look at it.  Put
it against a piece of dark stuff if you want to
see it properly."
</p>

<p>
She drew a pair of slender emerald ear-rings
towards her.
</p>

<p>
"These would do nicely for Lavinia some
day," she began, but broke off and picked up a
little gold ring set with an insignificant
sapphire.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Dorset, look at this," she exclaimed.
"That's what Geoffrey gave me after his very
first book was published."
</p>

<p>
She looked at it reminiscently, not hearing
Miss Dorset's comment of "Indeed, how very
interesting."
</p>

<p>
"It was not long after we were married," she
said presently.  "We married young, you know,
and old Mr. Greene was very angry with Geoffrey
for making writing his career.  He had
been in his father's engineering works first of
all and then found he was too unhappy to go on
with it.  I was engaged to him then and I
encouraged him to go on with his writing.  I said
I'd marry him as soon as he liked and not mind
about being poor, but he wasn't to start on a
career he didn't care for.  So I went to Papa and
said I was going to marry Geoffrey at once and
would do it more happily if I had his permission."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene laughed her quiet infrequent
laugh as she added contentedly:
</p>

<p>
"I was a bold young thing, you know.  In
those days it was a different matter to beard
your father.  But I didn't care for anything but
Geoffrey, and Papa behaved very nicely to me.
He gave me this as one of my wedding
presents."
</p>

<p>
She groped among the cases, opened one, and
displayed an old-fashioned round brooch
consisting of a large amethyst surrounded by pearls
in an elaborate gold setting.
</p>

<p>
"It looks clumsy now," she said, touching it
with kindly fingers.  "But round brooches were
all the fashion then and I was very pleased with
it.  Mamma was very angry about my marriage,
but then she was a very narrow woman; she
never moved with the times."
</p>

<p>
Miss Dorset enjoyed a momentary flash of
insight.  She perceived that the old lady sitting
beside her, herself a great-grandmother, was
speaking of her mother, whose memory would
normally be blurred by the clouds of half a
century, in just the tones of clear resentment
that any young woman might employ to-day.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene was back in the past, and even
Miss Dorset caught something of the combined
fire and delicacy that must have inspired such
independence, such courage, and&mdash;according to
the standards of 1870&mdash;such immodesty as to
enable a betrothed young girl to arrange her
own marriage in the teeth of her mother's
disapproval.
</p>

<p>
For a moment it was all so vivid to Miss
Dorset that she gave way to a spasm of
indignation and admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Parents were far too harsh," she said.  "It
was shocking of the old father to try and push
Mr. Greene into a business he didn't care for,
but it must be splendid for you to think how
you helped Mr. Greene to succeed."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene only answered by a vague:
"What do you say?"
</p>

<p>
She had leaped thirty years and was fingering
rather sadly a star sapphire beautifully set
in diamonds to form a brooch.  Presently she
laid it down and sitting with her hands folded
in her lap fell into one of those wideawake
trances that ended too often in melancholy.
</p>

<p>
"What a beautiful brooch that is," ventured
Miss Dorset.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer and no indication that
Mrs. Greene had even heard the remark.
</p>

<p>
Miss Dorset tried again.
</p>

<p>
"Is it a star sapphire?" she asked.  "I don't
think I've ever seen one like that."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene roused herself, but she spoke
heavily and limply.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's a star sapphire, Geoffrey gave it to
me."  There was a long pause.  "We had a
quarrel," she said at last, "nothing very much;
it began just as a disagreement of opinion, but
I was very hot-tempered; I always said more
than I meant.  So Geoffrey gave me this brooch,"
she ended, inconsequently, a little furrow of
pain forming between her eyebrows at the
recollection.
</p>

<p>
Miss Dorset murmured something inaudible,
unable to offer any comfort for a quarrel which
had begun and ended probably thirty years ago.
Rather awkwardly, anxious to make a diversion,
she moved come cases nearer to Mrs. Greene.
By chance one of them contained the brooch
which had been spoken of in the morning.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I want," said Mrs. Greene
triumphantly, her depression completely
banished.  "That's the brooch I want you to have;
it was another of my wedding presents and I
used to wear it a great deal, but I never wear
rubies now, and I would like you to have it."
</p>

<p>
It was a very fine ruby.  The sun lit up its
dark wine-coloured heart and turned to fire the
diamond pentacle in which it was set.
</p>

<p>
Miss Dorset caught something of its glow
and radiance.
</p>

<p>
"I can't possibly thank you," she said, "I've
never had anything so lovely before; it will
give me real happiness."
</p>

<p>
With an unusually impulsive and graceful
movement she lifted Mrs. Greene's hand and
kissed it.
</p>

<p>
The old lady was amazed at the happiness
she had caused.  She remembered her thoughts
of the morning.  The brooch had seemed then a
cold and trivial thing.  Now, lying on Miss
Dorset's hand, enriched by her unconcealed
pleasure, it became a warm symbol of affection
and gratitude.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene thought of services rendered, of
fine discretions, of considerateness carried far
beyond the borders of duty into the realm of
intuition, and she was filled with immense satisfaction.
There were good things in life: loyalties,
restraints, disinterested devotion.  One lived from
day to day, from year to year, and at the end it
was bitten deep into the mind that baseness was
transitory, but that good quality endured.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene braced herself.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Dorset," she said sternly, "all my life
I've cared for the quality of things and people.
I'm old now; old enough to know the truth
that lies in platitudes, but if you see me slipping
into an easy tolerance, and putting up with the
second rate, you'll know that I'm dead, though
my body lives on."
</p>

<p>
Miss Dorset was startled.  Inadvertently she
expressed her crude and simple opinion,
speaking as to an equal, happily forgetful of the
responsibility of youth towards age; a
responsibility that leads to concealments and
subterfuges, to the elimination from conversation of
anything that might be unpalatable or alarming;
to the whole softening process that makes
for safety and, presumably, content.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, Mrs. Greene," she said confidently.
"You'll never become tolerant.  Young
Mrs. Geoffrey often says you live on your critical
faculty and that it's my duty to give you
something to pull to pieces every day."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene was delighted.  She laughed
with pure pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Helen says that, does she?  Well, she's quite
right; I'm a malicious intolerant old woman,
and I don't suppose I'll change now."
</p>

<p>
At that moment there was the sound of a car
drawing up at the front door.  Mrs. Greene
looked in consternation at Miss Dorset.
</p>

<p>
"There's Sarah," she said.  "And I've done
nothing that I meant to.  I haven't even decided
whether my necklace needs cleaning or not.
You'll have to put all these away now, Miss
Dorset, and get them out again to-morrow.  But
it doesn't matter; I've had a very happy
afternoon and now I'll go into the drawing-room and
wait for Sarah."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hugh Greene arrived with a characteristic
absence of fuss and impedimenta.  She
greeted Miss Dorset in the hall with a friendly
smile, chatted to her for a moment and then
said:
</p>

<p>
"I'll find Mrs. Greene in the drawing-room,
I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you like to take your coat off, and
have a little rest?" suggested Miss Dorset.
</p>

<p>
"No thank you.  I'm not tired; it's nothing of
a journey; less than two hours in the train."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hugh spoke briskly and appeared quite
fresh and trim in her small, old-fashioned hat
and the neat dark coat and skirt of a mode which
she had first worn ten years ago, and had simply
caused to be repeated ever since.
</p>

<p>
Eight years younger than her sister-in-law,
she was at a different stage of life; still active
and independent, able to make plans, carry out
her arrangements, and work indefatigably in her
garden regardless of wind and weather.  Miss
Dorset, however, looking at her with an eye
trained by experience to note each subtle stage
of increasing frailty, thought that Mrs. Hugh
was beginning to show her age, and watching
her walk through to the drawing-room she
decided that her air of youthfulness was deceptive;
it was more an effect of manner than of
physique.  Later, when she rejoined the two old
ladies for tea, she was confirmed in her opinion.
They were both quite definitely old ladies; one
apparently well, the other obviously in broken
health, but certainly of the same generation.
</p>

<p>
She placed a little table beside each of their
chairs and busied herself with the tea things.
</p>

<p>
As she poured out, she was keenly aware of
Mrs. Greene's mood, sensitive to the incisive
alertness of her speech without actually hearing
what she was saying.  All this expenditure of
energy would have to be paid for by extra rest.
Mrs. Greene's personality might over-ride her
bodily ills and lend her a moment of spurious
strength, but the consequent nervous reaction
would be all the more merciless.
</p>

<p>
Miss Dorset sighed as she refilled the tea
cups.  The alternatives were so clear.
Mrs. Greene could either relax her grip on life and
slide into a state of comfortable coma, with no
ups and down, no painful efforts and no particular
alleviations, or she could live on for a few
years paying a heavy toll for her good moments
in hours of depression and physical malaise.
There was no choice; the first was
temperamentally impossible.
</p>

<p>
Miss Dorset sighed again, and then resolutely
set herself to join in the conversation.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene's expression was so deliberately
blank as to be provocative.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she was saying, "Jessica and Hugh
get home on Tuesday, but I shan't be seeing
them till the party on Friday, I expect."
</p>

<p>
"What party do you mean?" asked Mrs. Hugh
innocently.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you haven't had your invitation yet?"
Mrs. Greene replied with feigned surprise.
"Well, it's a little dinner Edith is giving for the
six Mrs. Greenes.  It will be so nice to have a
reunion that we can all enjoy."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hugh looked aghast.
</p>

<p>
"I never heard you say anything so fantastic
in all your life," she said decisively.  "You may
have something in common with your daughters-in-law,
but I certainly have not.  I never agree
with Edith, and I disapprove of Dora."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would say that," said Mrs. Greene
triumphantly.  "You've got some sense,
Sarah.  It's a shocking plan, but when Edith
gets an idea into her head you know very well
nothing will get it out again."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say you're taking the
trouble to go up to town just to fall in with a
whim of Edith's?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene looked a little helpless, and
Miss Dorset interposed quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Rodney is coming in the car to fetch
Mrs. Greene.  He is very anxious to have her
up in town again, even if it's only for a night."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hugh's rather stern face softened.
</p>

<p>
"Rodney is a good boy," she said.  "You
know, Margaret, the last time I saw him it
struck me that he was looking very like
Geoffrey did at that age."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?" asked Mrs. Greene
eagerly.  "I sometimes see it, and then sometimes
I can't see it, but I think Hugh is very
like his grandfather."
</p>

<p>
"Not nearly so good-looking.  Geoffrey was
very good-looking, Margaret; he had a fine
scholarly head."
</p>

<p>
"Hugh was handsome, too, Sarah.  We were
two fine couples in the old days.  Lavinia is like
what I used to be."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think she is," agreed Mrs. Hugh.
"And Martin is a nice little boy, and very
sensibly brought up.  Tell me, Margaret," she asked
suddenly, "does it make you feel different
to be a great-grandmother?  You're at the
head of such a long line and I'm so isolated
in a way."
</p>

<p>
She broke off, and then added before
Mrs. Greene had time to answer.
</p>

<p>
"Not that I'm not fond of Rodney and my
own nephew Roger.  Only not having children
and children's children makes me feel a little
stranded sometimes now that my own generation
has ebbed away and left me high and
dry."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene looked at her intently.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know you felt like that, Sarah," she
said.  "But I tell you this.  At our age children
are very little use.  It's Geoffrey I think of all
the time, and I don't doubt but that Hugh is
nearly always in your mind.
</p>

<p>
"That's quite true," answered Mrs. Hugh
simply.  "I think it's only natural that such
happy marriages as ours were, should remain
green in our minds.  I've never grown acclimatised
to life without him.  Somehow familiar
things don't seem so familiar."
</p>

<p>
Silence fell and Miss Dorset looked at the
two quiet figures whose silence covered so
adequately their pain and rebellion.
</p>

<p>
"If you would care for a little rest before
dinner, I think perhaps we ought to go upstairs
now," she suggested.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene got up, waving away the proffered
arm, which she would accept only in the
absence of visitors.
</p>

<p>
"Take Mrs. Hugh to her room," she ordered.
"Sarah, we've put you in the front room
because of the view; the trees are lovely just
now."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure they are; it gave me quite a pang
to leave Lynton even for a week," said
Mrs. Hugh conversationally as she left the room in
the wake of Miss Dorset.
</p>

<p>
Left alone Mrs. Greene walked with difficulty
over to the window.  When Miss Dorset
came back she found her standing there, a small
crumpled figure, darkly outlined against the
orange curtains, gazing at the gathering dusk
with the inscrutability of her many years carved
round her mouth, but with a mysteriously youthful
speculation alight in her eyes.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
Dinner was a meal of some ceremony.
</p>

<p>
The two old ladies sat at either end of the
table with Miss Dorset at Mrs. Greene's right,
ready to help if her unsteady hands proved
unequal to the task of cutting her meat, or raising
her wine glass, which she insisted on having
filled to the precisely correct level.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene, in spite of all her modern
outlook, had retained in many ways an
old-fashioned eye, and she had never been able to
accustom herself to the fashion for bare tables.
It struck her as slightly barbaric; not in
keeping with the solemn tradition that had built
itself up around the ritual of dinner, a tradition
that to her mind necessitated the use of fine
linen, heavy silver, and good china.  Candle-light,
too, was abhorrent to her.  The flicker of
each separate candle, and the alternate dark
patches and uncertain pools of light on the table
which she considered should be illuminated by a
steady radiance, suggested to her something
slightly decadent and certainly grotesque.  So
the table was lit from directly above, by a round
brass fitting, each of whose five globes was
covered by a rose silk shade.  This, with sconces
on every wall, effectively dissipated the gloominess
of the severe shadowy room.
</p>

<p>
This evening one of the finest damask cloths
with inlets of lace at each corner had been put
on in honour of Mrs. Hugh, and the heavy
silver bowl in the centre with its four attendant
silver vases arranged diamond-wise contained
the last poor blooms from the garden, mixed
with leaves whose colours ranged from saffron
through orange and russet to flaming scarlet.
</p>

<p>
It was in keeping with Mrs. Greene's love of
formality that the conversation at dinner should
run along prescribed lines.  General topics of
any sort, trivial or abstruse, she welcomed&mdash;but
forbade anything of a personal nature to be
discussed; gossip must be kept for the drawing-room.
This was sometimes a severe trial to Miss
Dorset who at the end of a wearisome day found
herself forced to eschew just those comfortable
irrelevances which were all that occurred to her
tired mind.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hugh, however, like Mrs. Greene, was
of that self-effacing generation of women that
had been brought up to make conversation at
dinner with the sole purpose of entertaining the
gentlemen, and she perfectly understood why
clothes and personalities were permissible in one
room and taboo in another.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly throughout the meal the two old
ladies were accustomed to exchange a number of
superficial generalisations which both were too
fatigued to pursue.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene's single moment of animation
was also one of indignation.
</p>

<p>
"You've not drunk your sherry," she said
crossly.  "It's still the sherry that Geoffrey laid
down and I've got enough palate left to know
that it's good.  Why don't you drink it?"
</p>

<p>
"You know I never care much about wine,"
Mrs. Hugh replied, "I think the only thing I
really enjoy is a glass of good claret."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I remembered that," she said.  "I told them
to bring up a bottle of the Pontet Canet.  We had
some up last time Rodney was here, and it's got
a beautiful bouquet."
</p>

<p>
"I shall enjoy that, Margaret," said Mrs. Hugh.
"You know I've never had to add anything
to the cellar since Hugh died.  Sometimes
I've been very sorry to think of the 1906 Veuve
Clicquot going past it's best; in fact once or twice
I've thought of giving it to one of the young
couples, but young people don't seem to have
cellars nowadays."
</p>

<p>
"That's true."  Mrs. Greene's assent was a
little morose.  "They don't go in for anything so
permanent.  If they want something to drink
they just ring up a shop and order a few
bottles."
</p>

<p>
"There have been great changes in the
last twenty years," reflected Mrs. Hugh.  "Some
for the worse, no doubt, and many for the
better, but I confess I no longer find myself
able to adapt very readily.  I'm too old to
change."
</p>

<p>
This was dangerously like an expression of
personal feeling and Mrs. Hugh hastily covered
her tracks by asking Mrs. Greene's opinion of a
new book of travel.
</p>

<p>
Dinner progressed slowly.  The pheasant
appeared, three small slices of breast were eaten
by the three ladies, it was removed and the peach
tart took its place.  Mrs. Hugh, for courtesy's
sake, toyed with a minute piece of pastry, Miss
Dorset enjoyed a reasonable helping, but
Mrs. Greene lacked the energy even to taste it.  It
was succeeded by a savoury, which again for
courtesy's sake all three ladies made an effort
to eat.
</p>

<p>
At last the interminable meal was ended.  A
little food had been eaten, a little wine drunk,
and a prolonged exhibition of fortitude and
good manners had been given by Mrs. Greene,
whose weakness clamoured for the easy comfort
of a tray by the fire, but whose instincts and
training drove her to endure the full ceremony
prescribed by the laws of good society.
</p>

<p>
She was very tired when they went through
to the drawing-room.  She sat relaxed and
huddled in her armchair, stretching out her chill
hands to the fire, which leaped and spluttered.
</p>

<p>
"The logs are green," she said dreamily.  "But
I like to hear them hiss like that."
</p>

<p>
"I like all country sounds and sights,"
answered Mrs. Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"That's what you live on, Sarah, I understand
very well; Lynton is what you live on
from day to day; and you've got Hugh and your
past for a background."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause, broken presently by Mrs. Hugh
who spoke quickly and jerkily in her insistency.
</p>

<p>
"I find Lynton very lovely," she said.  "It's
to satisfying and complete.  I turn over the earth
and take out things and plant other things, and
they grow and flower, and when they die, I plant
something else.  And it all goes on round and
round, so that I feel quite confident that beauty
renews itself even if it doesn't last, and so I'm
able to be happy."
</p>

<p>
Her credo ended abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"We're optimists, Sarah," said Mrs. Greene.
"You know, only this morning I was thinking
something like that, but I don't remember now
what it was.  I forget things; I forget the
simplest things sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Don't let that worry you," advised Mrs. Hugh,
gently.  "We all forget things when
we're tired."
</p>

<p>
"I worry when I'm tired," confided Mrs. Greene.
"Everything worries me; the thought
of Edith's party next week worries me.  I don't
feel I can face it."
</p>

<p>
She relapsed into silence.  In the glow of
the fire her face looked pinched and wan.
Suddenly it sharpened into irritation.
</p>

<p>
"I must go to bed, Sarah," she said.  "I'm
sorry to leave you so early, but I've talked
enough for to-night, and I'll see you in the
morning."
</p>

<p>
She stood up, tremulous and uncertain.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Dorset," she called querulously, "help
me to bed, Miss Dorset, I'm tired."

MRS. HUGH GREENE

<h3>
MRS. HUGH GREENE
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing this morning, Aunt
Sarah?" asked Mary Dodds on the first morning
of Mrs. Hugh Greene's visit.  "I have to do
some shopping, but I'd love it if you would
come with me."
</p>

<p>
"No thank you, dear," answered Mrs. Greene.
"I have an appointment at 12 o'clock,
and if you'll excuse me, I won't come back to
lunch."
</p>

<p>
"You're sure you won't be too tired if you
stay out both morning and afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
Young Mrs. Dodds was genuinely solicitous,
and her husband, Roger, added quietly, "You're
not looking too well, Aunt Sarah; why not see
a doctor while you are in town?"
</p>

<p>
"That is just what I'm doing at 12 o'clock,
but you needn't worry, my dears; I'm a little
run down perhaps, and don't forget that I'm
seventy this year so I can hardly expect to be
quite as active as I used to be.  But I shall come
quietly back and have a rest before tea, if I
may."
</p>

<p>
"Let me bring tea up to your room and have
it there with you," suggested Mary, "Ellen is
out this afternoon, and I shall be getting tea
myself anyhow, and it would be nice for you to
have it in bed and then rest on till dinner-time."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene turned to Roger.
</p>

<p>
"Your wife is the most thoughtful young
woman I know," she said briskly, "You did
very well for yourself when you married
her."
</p>

<p>
Roger laughed, kissed Mary, who was pink
and flustered, and left for his office.
</p>

<p>
"You can't think how much nicer you are than
most relations-in-law, Aunt Sarah," said Mary
impulsively, "you're so much easier than my
mother-in-law somehow.  She expects so much
of me that I just get futile and incompetent
when she is about."
</p>

<p>
"I've never had any children, you know, and
I think perhaps that makes me less exacting than
Elinor.  She has always made too many demands
on Roger, and that leads to difficulties.
</p>

<p>
"You're awfully wise," said Mary slowly,
"I think all old people are much wiser than
middle-aged ones, especially women; perhaps in
ten years' time Mrs. Dodds will be quite
sensible."
</p>

<p>
She smiled at Mrs. Greene who thought of
her uncertain, irritable, dissatisfied sister-in-law,
and smiled back at the improbability of her
developing into the type of tranquil old lady that
Mary seemed to hope for.  Then, looking more
closely at Mary, she noticed that there was an
expression of strain and fatigue on her usually
pink and healthy face.
</p>

<p>
"You're not looking very well yourself,
Mary," she said.
</p>

<p>
Mary hesitated for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to tell you," she said uncertainly;
"Roger thought I oughtn't to because I haven't
told his mother yet, but after all you're very
discreet, aren't you?  We're having a baby in
about six months, and he is rather worried about
it because we can't really afford it."
</p>

<p>
Her lip trembled a little, but she steadied
her voice and went on, "I'm really glad about
it even though it does mean getting rid of Ellen
and only having a cook and economising a lot,
but of course it isn't much fun for Roger, and
he does work hard."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think that is a very nice piece of
news," said Mrs. Greene warmly, "I shall
thoroughly enjoy having a grandnephew or niece,
and you must let me pay your doctor and help
you in any way I can.  As a matter of fact I get
tired sometimes of hearing my sister-in-law
talking of her great-grandchild and all her
grandchildren.  You don't know old Mrs. Greene
do you?  She's a delightful woman, but sometimes
I feel she forgets there are other young
couples in the world besides Lavinia and Martin
and the young Geoffreys, and now the Hughs."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you ever so much, Aunt Sarah, it's
lovely of you, and it will be a weight off Roger's
mind.  He does work so hard, and he earns so
little."
</p>

<p>
Mary's voice rose almost to a wail, but Aunt
Sarah only said crisply:
</p>

<p>
"Oughtn't you to go and see the cook now?
You mustn't bother about me; I'll write a letter
or two before I go out."
</p>

<p>
Young Mrs. Dodds gulped a little and blew
her nose, but as the parlourmaid came in, cast an
injured glance at the two ladies still sitting over
the breakfast table and then swept out with
pursed lips, she was sufficiently in command of
herself to laugh and say, "I shan't mind getting
rid of her anyhow.  She's horribly haughty."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene left alone, sat for a moment in
thought before she crossed the hall to the small
living room.  She wondered how Roger's inadequate
income was going to be stretched to meet
the demands of the unborn child which was
already beginning to assume a definite
importance in her mind.
</p>

<p>
I'm as bad as Margaret, she thought; I
didn't really care so very much when her
great-grandchild was born, and yet it was my
great-grandnephew after all.  But there is something
more intimate about this one; it's a Dodds, and I
feel possessive about it.  Odd that after being
Mrs. Hugh Greene for nearly fifty years, I
should still be Sarah Dodds.
</p>

<p>
Her thoughts turned back to Roger; something
ought to be done for him; his position in
the rather depressing solicitor's office where he
worked was unsatisfactory.
</p>

<p>
As Ellen again entered the room, armed with
a formidable frown and a tray, Mrs. Greene
went across the hall and sat down to write.  She
found herself unable to concentrate on her
letters.  Either the thought of the impending
interview was draining her of her usually
resolute vitality, or the news that Mary had given
her had provoked an emotional reaction.
</p>

<p>
Her heart stirred almost painfully as she
thought of Roger, his enduring good qualities,
his affection for her, his social inadequacy and
uncouthness that concealed a good brain and a
sense of humour.  She had been pleased with his
marriage to Mary, the least exacting of women,
unaware of most of her husband's deficiencies,
and tolerant of those she recognised.
</p>

<p>
A small sinister idea insinuated itself into
Mrs. Greene's mind.  Unaware that she spoke
aloud she formulated her fear in words.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps on this bright November day I shall
have to make my will, and then Mary need not
economise over her baby."
</p>

<p>
The rich autumn sun struck a shaft across the
desk that warmed her chill hand, but
Mrs. Greene shivered as she looked across the
narrow street and steadied herself to accept the
immediate future.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Dr. Stiff looked at the quiet elderly woman
who was sitting on the other side of his desk,
and chose his words carefully.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid, Mrs. Greene, that I shall have
to call upon your courage and fortitude to listen
to what I cannot avoid telling you.  I gather that
your suspicions amounted almost to a certainty
before you consulted me, and I am unfortunately
forced to confirm them.  There is a
considerable growth in the left breast, which, owing
to the state of your heart, can't be removed.
That being so, we can only regard it as a definite
signal which must not be ignored."
</p>

<p>
He spoke gently, but the crude fact implicit
in his words stuck out clearly.  There was a
moment's pause.  Mrs. Greene's hands were
folded in her lap; her throat felt a little dry,
and for a moment the walls of the room wavered
uncertainly towards her and the motes dancing
in a streak of sun across the floor seemed to
swell gigantically and overpoweringly.  But as
she cleared her throat and prepared to speak,
they diminished and the room resumed its
normal proportions.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said steadily.  "I quite
understand.  You mean that I have cancer and
you are not able to operate.  How long can I
expect to live?"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Stiff looked distressed at the uncompromising
question, and his hand hovered over the
bell as he answered:
</p>

<p>
"The disease is in its final stage, Mrs. Greene.
You must have had many attacks of pain
recently, and there won't be very many more."
</p>

<p>
He pressed the bell as he spoke, and almost
immediately a nurse appeared with a little tray
containing a glass and a decanter of brandy.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene smiled.  "No, thank you, Nurse,"
she said, and her voice had its natural buoyancy
as she turned to Dr. Stiff.  "My husband
never liked me to drink spirits of any sort, and
this has not been a shock to me.  Indeed in some
ways it is almost convenient."
</p>

<p>
She thought of Roger and then asked abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I live for six months?"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Stiff shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"It's impossible for me to give a definite
date," he said.  "But I think not more than
three."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene pressed her hand to her treacherous
breast as she thought of Mary and Roger's
child that would be born in the Spring.
</p>

<p>
"That is a disappointment to me," she said,
"but only a very trivial one.  My husband died
eight years ago; we were very devoted to each
other and since then I have often felt as if I were
waiting with my hat and jacket on for some
vehicle to take me to him.  Now that fancy is
gone; I see that the vehicle is my illness which
will soon come to a conclusion, and I thank you
very much for your consideration and kindness
to me."
</p>

<p>
She rose to go.  For a moment Dr. Stiff held
her hand as he said:
</p>

<p>
"It's I who thank you, Mrs. Greene.  My
work is very often both trying and depressing,
and to meet with such courage and control as
yours is a great stimulus to me."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I'm very old-fashioned," said
Mrs. Greene.  "I've never learnt to take life so
vehemently and rebelliously as young people do
nowadays.  I sometimes think they lack a sense
of humour and proportion.  Goodbye and thank
you again."
</p>

<p>
She left the room, unhurried and untroubled,
oblivious of the fact that she left behind her a
man filled with amazement at the dignity and
decorum of her generation.
</p>

<p>
As she sat in a taxi on the way to lunch, Sarah
Greene was busy with arrangements: first of all
she must make an appointment with her solicitors
and see to her will.  A feeling of warm
gratitude to her dead husband shot across her
mind as she remembered that he had expressly
stated that she was to leave the bulk of his
considerable fortune to relations and friends for
whom she cared.  Lynton was her own of course,
both house and land, but she was glad that she
was under no moral obligation to leave Greene
money to Greenes; she was perfectly free to
make life as happy and tranquil as an assured
income could make it, for Mary and Roger
Dodds.
</p>

<p>
Then a nursing home must be considered.
Mrs. Greene suppressed a slight tremor as she
thought of the crudity and awkwardness of a
death in the house: the embarrassed, tearful
servants; the relations whose perfectly sincere
grief could not prevent them feeling an intense
relief at the approach of a meal, followed by
an equally intense shame at the thought of
enjoying food with poor Aunt Sarah lying
upstairs; the desultory and spasmodic conversations;
the whole painful interregnum between
normal life before the death occurred and
normal life resumed after the funeral.  A
nursing-home in London would certainly have
advantages.  Sarah Greene would be able to die
as unobstrusively as she hoped she had lived.
</p>

<p>
Before finding her way to the restaurant of
the large shop in which she intended to lunch,
Mrs. Greene made a few methodical purchases.
She had intended to buy half a dozen pairs of
the thick woollen stockings which she usually
wore for gardening, but in view of her curtailed
future she mechanically reduced the order to
three.  She did not however hesitate to order a
new mackintosh, since her old one was worn
out, and a future, however short, was unthinkable
if it withheld from her the promise of
rainy walks on soft November afternoons with
dusk dropping behind the long row of beeches
that bordered the avenue up to Lynton, the
house she had loved and cared for these last
forty-five years.
</p>

<p>
Later while she ate her usual plain lunch she
reviewed deliberately in some detail, the
sentimental aspect of the situation.  Not again would
she see the daffodils swaying on their stems in the
spring winds that every year swept Lynton; not
again would she see the amazing blue of summer
skies through the amazing green of beech trees;
other hands would snap off the dead pansy
heads and pick the lupins ranged along the
mellow wall.
</p>

<p>
A moment of forlornness, grim augury of the
desolate weeks ahead, fell upon Sarah Greene,
sitting in the crowded restaurant, to outward
seeming an elderly woman contentedly eating
her lunch.  Panic squeezed her heart as she
thought of the creeping growth that was working
even now to her undoing, but her will
automatically reasserted itself.  Self-pity was
repugnant to her; she was of the generation that
held duty to be at the same time an aim
and a reward, that accepted frustrations and
tragedies as part of the necessary fabric of
life.
</p>

<p>
As she put down her coffee cup she dealt
sharply with herself.  Here I am, she thought,
sitting in a ridiculous basket chair in a pink and
white restaurant.  I've just finished a pleasant
lunch and bought a good mackintosh and now
I'm letting myself get quite maudlin; I'm
giving way to foolish fancies over what is only
a natural event.  Much better go back to Roger's
little house and ring up my solicitor to make an
appointment for to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
The thought of this small task was enough to
re-establish Mrs. Greene's poise.  There were
still things to be done that only she could do,
and she sighed pleasurably as she remembered
that the Lynton gardens, greedy like all gardens
in their demand for time, care and skilled
forethought, would claim her, so long as she could
respond to any claim.
</p>

<p>
As she talked to Mary a couple of hours later,
Lynton was still uppermost in her mind, and
her interest in the various aspects of Mary's
coming maternity was kindly but perfunctory.
</p>

<p>
Mary was the perfectly conventional middle
class prospective mother, enjoying all the
emotions possible to a first pregnancy: pride in her
own adequacy, pride in the interest and the faint
spice of danger that would be attached to her for
the next few months&mdash;though as she eagerly
assured Aunt Sarah, "The doctor is frightfully
pleased with me.  He says I'm ideally fitted to
be a mother,"&mdash;pride in Roger's love and
anxiety, and an overwhelming pleasure at
the thought of a small naked body to be
intricately clothed in wools and muslins, laces
and ribbons.
</p>

<p>
"I feel it's going to be a girl," she said
positively.  "And I'm going to make her the
loveliest little frilled cloak with a tiny bonnet to
match."
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact, Mary," answered Aunt
Sarah equally positively, "I think it will be a
boy."
</p>

<p>
A look of keen delight suddenly lit up her face.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she said, "I've just had a delightful
idea.  Will you have your baby at Lynton?  I
should so much like him to be born there.  It
would give me the greatest pleasure to look
forward to the crocuses and hyacinths coming out
just about the right time.  You would be very
comfortable there, and I can promise you I
would not inconvenience you in any way."
</p>

<p>
"It's awfully kind of you, Aunt Sarah," Mary
spoke gratefully.  "It would be ideal of course.
I've been worried about a nursing home,
they're so expensive, and this house is terribly
inconvenient.  It's so small, and the hot water
is all downstairs, and that is awkward when
you're in bed.  Besides I don't believe Roger
would mind my being away from him.  After
all it's only an hour and a half to Lynton."
</p>

<p>
"I very much hope you'll arrange it, Mary."
</p>

<p>
"I really would love it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I want you to make a definite plan
and keep to it.  I have several reasons for asking
this; I don't want anything that may happen
to upset your plan."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing is likely to happen."  Mary's
thoughts were concentrated entirely on herself
and her condition.  "Everything is quite normal,
and I'm sure it will go all right."
</p>

<p>
"I'm quite sure, too," answered Aunt Sarah.
"I wasn't really thinking of that.  Things do
change you know, dear, and arrangements
sometimes have to be altered, but I don't want
anything to interfere with this.  You must talk
it over with Roger.  Now tell me, Mary, do you
feel well enough to go to a play to-night?  I
have a fancy for you and Roger and me to have
a little celebration.  If it doesn't put you out at
all, I suggest that we dine at the Berkeley and
go to a theatre."
</p>

<p>
"I'd love it.  Thank you very much.  Shall
I go and telephone to Roger and tell him not
to be late?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes do, Mary; and ask him to get three
stalls for any good play that we will all enjoy."
</p>

<p>
"I'll get tea, too, when I'm downstairs," said
Mary happily, "I do hope you don't mind my
having to do it; I really didn't dare ask Ellen
to stay in, and there's never any use expecting
cook to do anything extra."
</p>

<p>
At the thought of Ellen and cook, Mary
nervously wrinkled her forehead, but the frown
was chased away by an expression of amazed
relief as a new idea dawned on her.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Sarah, if I have my baby at Lynton,
I shan't have to bother the least bit about
servants or dust or Roger's meals or anything.
How perfectly marvellous."
</p>

<p>
As Mary closed the door rather noisily, Sarah
Greene's sensibilities shrank from such a
robustly common-sensible point of view being
applied to her romantic project.  The idea of new
life in Lynton house coinciding with so much
vigorous new life in Lynton gardens was
compensation to her for her own death.  It struck the
right balance; more, it pleased her always
fastidious sense of the fitness of things, that she, an
old woman, should die before the turn of the
year when sap springs in the bough, and that her
grandnephew should be born in her house at
the time when apple trees blossom and lambs
play in the field.
</p>

<p>
This pastoral conception sustained a rude
shock when Mary translated it into terms of
dust and domestics.
</p>

<p>
Mary is a genuinely good capable girl, she
told herself, not imaginative, perhaps, but with
courage and intelligence, and most of the qualities
that Roger needs in a wife.  Even so, it was
difficult to see Mary at Lynton, ordering the
household, planning new effects for the misty
herbaceous border, lavishly stocking the formal
beds, attentive to the diurnal duties towards
flowers and trees and shrubs.
</p>

<p>
Sarah Greene thought of her other young
relations: Lavinia, mondaine, vivid, with a
delicate certainty of touch that enabled her to cover
her essential sophistication with a delightful
veneer of country simplicity.
</p>

<p>
Lavinia in green linen stooping over the rose
beds in the sunlight was perfect; Lavinia in
scarlet silk stepping out of the French window
to the moonlit terrace was perfect; her clothes
for a country weekend were admirable.  But
Lavinia waking day after day to the sound of
steady rain, was unimaginable.  She would
find herself without interests and without
resources.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene decided quite firmly that
Lavinia would not do for Lynton.
</p>

<p>
Helen and Geoffrey were not more promising
candidates.  Geoffrey's manifest uneasiness
in tweeds, his distaste for country pursuits no
less than Helen's restlessness and impatience,
rendered them ineligible.
</p>

<p>
Helen really paints well, thought Mrs. Greene.
It's a pity she so seldom finishes anything,
and that when she does, she just tosses it
aside and begins at once on something new.
</p>

<p>
A vision of Helen frenziedly digging up
week-old bulbs to see if they had sprouted
crossed Mrs. Greene's mind and she smiled.
</p>

<p>
Only Hugh and Jessica remained.  But
Jessica, the youngest Mrs. Greene, with her
small creamy face, her cool incisiveness to the
world and her passionate gentleness to Hugh
could never belong to Lynton.  She was too
slight and too brittle.  At moments she seemed
as vibrant as spun glass, at moments she dimmed
into a moony vagueness.  There was no stability
about her; she would never move with Lynton
through the steady roll of the seasons, taking
note of the almost imperceptible signs that
herald growth and decay.
</p>

<p>
Thinking it over, Mary was really much the
most suitable.  There was something slow-moving
and deep-rooted about her; she, was
practical but not trivial; she did not spend
herself on details but she never ignored them, and
she could take a long view of things.  She was
free from petty spites and envies, and she and
Roger would do very well.  As Sarah Greene
reached this conclusion the door opened to
admit Mary with the tea-tray and a letter,
addressed in Mrs. Rodney Greene's unmistakable
writing.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mary, I knew that letter was coming,
but I'd forgotten all about it."
</p>

<p>
"Is it something tiresome?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not exactly.  It's an invitation to dinner
next week at the Rodneys but I don't feel like
meeting people just at present."
</p>

<p>
Sarah Greene drew the letter rather reluctantly
from its envelope and read it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
  207, Sussex Square.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9th Nov.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
My dear Aunt Sarah,
</p>

<p>
Many thanks for your kind letter after the
wedding.  I am so glad you thought it all went
off nicely and that you weren't too tired.
</p>

<p>
I expect you have heard that Hugh and
Jessica get back on Tuesday after a delightful
honeymoon apparently.  We have had
several very happy post-cards from them,
though I must say I should have liked a
letter.
</p>

<p>
I have planned a little dinner-party for
them for Friday the 18th, to-morrow week,
at 7.45, which I do hope will suit you.  It is
only a family affair, but I am anxious that
all six Mrs. Greenes should meet and enjoy
each other, so I very much hope you will be
able to come.
</p>

<p>
With love from Rodney and myself,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Yours affectionately,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDITH GREENE.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Mrs. Rodney is having her party next
Friday," said Mrs. Greene slowly.  "I hadn't
meant to stay in town quite so long."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do stay, Aunt Sarah," urged Mary.
"We love having you and if you don't want to
go to Mrs. Rodney's we can easily think of
something.  Why not invent an engagement for
that evening?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said decisively.  "You know I
almost think I shall enjoy it, and I think it will
be salutary too."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean, salutary?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know, my dear, one begins to
think oneself and one's own affairs too
important; and then being plunged into a family
dinner party like that, one finds how relatively
unimportant one is.  The young people are taken
up with their own lives, and Mrs. Rodney is
busy about her arrangements, and poor Mrs. Edwin
is always very pre-occupied and so I shall
forget about my own troubles."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't have thought you had any
troubles or worries," was Mary's na√Øve
comment, to which Mrs. Greene responded briskly
and quite genuinely, "Well, no, Mary, I haven't
many.  One thing on my mind is my second
gardener.  He isn't turning out as well as I
expected.  He has bad hands for planting."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause as Mary poured out a cup
of tea and handed it to her Aunt who thanked
her and added:
</p>

<p>
"You know it's very nice and luxurious to be
here like this and have tea brought to me.  Now
tell me about this evening; what did Roger
say?"
</p>

<p>
"He was delighted," said Mary.  "He says
he can get away fairly early from the office,
and he'll get the tickets on the way home.  And
he asked me to give you his love and ask what
it was you were celebrating?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene's heart missed a beat.  She felt
that she could hardly say, "I'm celebrating my
death sentence," and yet the melodramatic little
phrase nearly escaped her.  She hesitated for a
second and then said quite naturally:
</p>

<p>
"We're celebrating the very good news you
told me this morning, my dear Mary.  I'm very
happy about it; I shall enjoy having a grand-nephew."
</p>

<p>
Mary's face glowed with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"I never thought you'd be so pleased.
Would you like us to call him Hugh if he's a
boy?"
</p>

<p>
Sarah Greene took her hand and held it for
a moment.
</p>

<p>
"It's kind of you to think of it," she said,
"but no, Mary, I don't really think I'd like it.
I've never quite believed in calling children
after people; it doesn't seem to me to mean very
much; I'd rather you just called your boy any
name you liked."
</p>

<p>
"I had thought of Roger, but I'm not sure."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't be influenced by anyone; just
decide what name you like and keep to it.  It's
only a convention to name children after their
relations, and I don't quite believe in conventions
that are based on sentiment.  Perhaps we
get harder as we get older; I'm not sure.  But
it seems to me that my generation has a good
deal in common with yours.  We were very
differently brought up, of course, but we
arrived at rather the same conclusions as you
young people have now: a distaste for anything
too easy, or flabby, as you might call it."
</p>

<p>
She turned questioningly to Mary, who reflected
for a moment in the struggle to assemble
her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"I know what you mean," she said at last.  "I
do feel we've much more in common with people
of your age than people about forty-five or
fifty.  We're harder than they are, and we take
things in our stride like your generation did.  I
always think you were awfully brave.  And we're
a greedy generation, but I don't think we're
greedy in such a soft way as middle-aged people
are."
</p>

<p>
She stopped again to think, and then added:
</p>

<p>
"Your generation doesn't strike me as being
greedy at all.  You were all so awfully good at
self-sacrifice."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene laughed.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Mary," she expostulated, "that
sounds terrible&mdash;as if we were all would-be
martyrs.  Yes, indeed, we were just as greedy
as you are, but we wanted different things, and
I think we very often wanted them for other
people.  As wives, we were contented to be a
good deal in the background; we liked our
husbands to shine and we didn't need so much
personal success as women do nowadays.  But it
wasn't so very different after all; I know you
want things for Roger more than for yourself,
for instance."
</p>

<p>
"I do want a lot for Roger," agreed Mary
eagerly and Mrs. Greene exulted in the thought
of how much her death would do for this
satisfactory and devoted young couple.  Money she
could give them in her life-time, but what was
money compared to Lynton whose lovely
perfection was solace enough for the bitterness of
life and the fear of death?
</p>

<p>
She switched abruptly off this trend of
thought.
</p>

<p>
"If we are dining early and going out," she
said, "it's certainly time I got up and began to
think about dressing.  And we've never taken the
tray down.  Let me help you, Mary, like a good
child."
</p>

<p>
But Mary refused help, piled the tray up
competently and left the room.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene found herself strangely comforted
by this short and uneventful conversation.
Later, as she dressed, she thought about
the young Dodds and their contemporaries.
They have good points, these young people, she
decided finally; lots of courage and spirit; and
how pleasant it is to think that I, who was
brought up a model of deportment, at the end
of my life should find myself able to take
things in my stride.
</p>

<p>
She smiled over the phrase.  Uncouth and
slangy as it was, it seemed to her to show a good
enough standard, and when she went downstairs
she said gaily, "Roger, your wife's been
teaching me modern slang and I like it."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
The evening was a very happy one.  There was
a distinct air of festivity about the elderly woman
and her two young companions as they sat in
the restaurant enjoying dinner, liking and
admiring each other and full of pleasurable
anticipations of the play.
</p>

<p>
Mary looked pretty.  The lamps were
becomingly shaded and softened her too
pronounced features.  Roger's naturally sober
manner never lapsed into heaviness and much
of his anxiety had been allayed by the way in
which his aunt had not only welcomed the
news of his prospective son, but was determined
to help at what was undoubtedly a crisis in his
affairs.  Sarah Greene was lost in the pleasure
of the moment.  As she looked at Roger and
Mary and thought of them at Lynton, her heart
was warm and her mind at peace.
</p>

<p>
"My dear children," she said towards the
end of the dinner, "I'm very pleased with you
both; I want you to be very happy."
</p>

<p>
"This really is a celebration," said Mary
excitedly, "we are enjoying ourselves."
</p>

<p>
But Roger lifted his glass, and looking at
Mrs. Greene smiled charmingly.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like you to drink to our friendship, Aunt
Sarah," he said.  "I'm thirty-two now, and I've
appreciated you for quite twenty years.  Our
relationship is something I value very highly."
</p>

<p>
For a moment the emotional tension was high.
Rare tears sprang to Sarah Greene's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Roger," she stammered, "my dear
boy.  It is so sweet of you to say that; I'm getting
old and I need your affection."
</p>

<p>
She stopped uncertainly and Roger saw that
her usually imperturbable face was blurred and
twisted; the face of an old woman.
</p>

<p>
Before he had clearly taken in her sudden
change of feature Mary intervened.
</p>

<p>
"But, Aunt Sarah, we never think of you as
old; you have such a modern point of view."
</p>

<p>
Sarah Greene steadied herself and regained
her normal tranquil expression.
</p>

<p>
"I must be getting old," she announced, "because
you're making me feel quite sentimental.
In fact the sooner we get off to the theatre the
better."
</p>

<p>
She rose and went with Mary to fetch her
cloak, perfectly in command of herself again,
but a cold breath of foreboding had touched
Roger.
</p>

<p>
All evening, at the theatre listening to the
play, during the intervals while he talked to his
aunt and his wife, even in the taxi driving
home, he was teased by the recollection of
Mrs. Greene's face.  He felt as if he had been given
a clue to some puzzle, but not a final clue that
would unravel it.
</p>

<p>
Later, as he was falling asleep, he thought
contentedly: well anyhow she'll be here for ten
days; perhaps she'll tell me; I might be able to
help, whatever it is.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Sarah Greene wakened in the night straight
from deep sleep to considerable pain.
</p>

<p>
She had wakened often these last few months
to that same rending pain which numbed her
elbow, ran up her under arm, stabbed fiercely
at her arm-pit and concentrated itself in an
agonising grasp of her left breast.
</p>

<p>
She had lain on her back panting and sweating,
conscious of her heart thumping unevenly,
waiting for the first moment of relief when she
would be able to stretch out her hand for the
opiate that was always ready by her bed: an
opiate too mild to give sleep, but strong enough
to dull the edge of the attack.
</p>

<p>
When this stage had been reached and she
was no longer abandoned to the horror of the
moment, Mrs. Greene almost invariably found
herself betrayed into moments, and even hours,
of pure panic, when speculation as to the nature
of her disease forced itself on her reluctant
mind.
</p>

<p>
Time and again she had brought herself to
the point of deciding to see a specialist; time
and again she had told herself that she knew
what it was&mdash;cancer&mdash;and she would repeat the
word, Cancer; cancer is what is wrong with you
Sarah Greene; but always there had been an
element of uncertainty to torment her with a
hope too frail to build on but too tough to
disregard.
</p>

<p>
These hours of desperate indecision had
culminated at last in the appointment with
Dr. Stiff, whose verdict left no loophole, as
Mrs. Greene remembered when the pain began to
subside.
</p>

<p>
Instead, she was conscious of a feeling of
comfortable relaxation.  The ugly possibility
established as an inevitable fact, had lost its horror;
it simply had to be accepted and dealt with.
</p>

<p>
Lying there with her face turned to the small
window of Mary's spare bedroom Sarah Greene
found that she was perfectly happy.  Now that
no further struggle was possible and that a
conclusion had been reached, she had fallen into a
condition of luxurious restfulness which she
decided would probably last till her death,
broken of course by successive bouts of pain, and
by small variations of mood.  But fundamentally
she was at ease and likely to remain so.
</p>

<p>
A small wind blew along the street between
the two rows of tall narrow houses, and fluttered
the curtains at her window.
</p>

<p>
She sighed; it was a London wind; even in
the cool of the autumn night long before dawn,
it was a London wind.  She got up restlessly, put
on a dressing-gown and sat down in a chair
beside the low window.
</p>

<p>
The house opposite seemed indecently near
and indecently small.  There could be no dignity
of life in so cabined a space.  Everywhere she
saw a huddle of houses and chimneys.  Wind
blew along the street again and a casement
curtain flapped out of the window opposite and
filled her with distaste.  It was so close to her,
this grotesquely flapping piece of linen that
belonged to people whose name she did not know,
whose lives were alien to hers.
</p>

<p>
A sudden nostalgia for Lynton broke like a
storm in her heart; Lynton where her windows
looked out on lawns and fields and beech trees,
and even the sky seemed more remote.
</p>

<p>
She stood up, her fingers pressed nervously
on the window sill, and whispered, "I must go
back to Lynton, I must go at once.  It's
impossible to spend a whole week in town.  I'll go
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
There was a gentle knock at the door.  Resentful
of any intrusion she said sternly, "Come in,"
and waited, a rigid small figure at the window.
</p>

<p>
Roger came quietly round the door and shut
it carefully.
</p>

<p>
"May I come in for a few minutes?" he
asked, "Mary's asleep, but I wakened up and
heard you moving about, and thought I'd like
to come and talk to you.  I've had a feeling all
evening that there was something wrong, or not
exactly wrong; I don't quite know."
</p>

<p>
He broke off uncertainly, then lifted a chair
over to the window and said gently:
</p>

<p>
"Let's sit and talk for a little; will you tell me
if there's anything on your mind?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene sat down again.  Her resentment
had died.  Roger in pyjamas and dressing-gown
looked young and tentative, and yet there was
about him an air of steadfastness that suited the
occasion.  She looked at him and said lightly:
</p>

<p>
"My dear, this is a very funny scene.  You
and I sitting here at the window in the middle of
a cold November night."
</p>

<p>
But Roger only answered:
</p>

<p>
"Don't put me off, Aunt Sarah.  I feel there
is something wrong, and I do want you to tell me."
</p>

<p>
She sat silent.  It had never occurred to her to
take anyone into her confidence; the thought of
being pitied was too upsetting; but Roger was
different.  He would be able to help; he was
strong and reliable and dignified.  Supposing she
told him, he would not obtrude his knowledge
of her secret during the next few months, and
indeed he must be fond of her, she decided, or
he would never have guessed at the existence of
trouble for he was not naturally intuitive.
</p>

<p>
She took a rapid decision and then spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you came in to-night, Roger.  I
would like to tell you something rather important
both to you and to me.  I had never thought
of telling, but now I feel I would like to
do so."
</p>

<p>
She paused for a moment, looking down into
the quiet street, and then continued:
</p>

<p>
"I saw a specialist to-day as you know, and he
told me what I've feared for some months.  I've
got cancer, Roger dear, and they can't operate or
do anything for it."
</p>

<p>
Unconsciously she tightened her grasp of his
hand and hurried on.  "And you see dear, I
haven't much time left; only a few months in
fact, and you can help me to arrange all sorts
of things if you will."
</p>

<p>
She stopped, a little breathless, and looked at
Roger.  He was sitting very still but she could
see the muscles of his throat twisting as he
swallowed and swallowed again, still in silence.
When at last he answered her his voice came
huskily from a dry throat.
</p>

<p>
"I never guessed at anything like this, Aunt
Sarah.  I never dreamed of anything so terrible.
I don't suppose you want me to tell you how
sorry I am"&mdash;He broke off and then burst out,
"It's hopelessly inadequate just to say I'm
sorry; it means far more than that."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, my dear, you'll waken Mary if you
talk so loud; and listen, Roger, I don't want you
to feel like this.  I'm an old woman and I've not
got much to live for, so it seems quite natural and
right to me.  I don't want you to get worked up
about it; I want you to help me."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will," answered Roger.  "You
must tell me what to do.  But you must realise,
Aunt Sarah, that this is a bad knock to me; it's
so awful to have you here like this, here with me
now, and to know at the same time that you're
so ill."
</p>

<p>
He was obviously unstrung, but Sarah Greene
was too intent on her subject even to notice.  Her
soft untroubled voice went on:
</p>

<p>
"It isn't awful to know beforehand, Roger;
it's splendid, because of Lynton.  Lynton really
is important, and I can make so many preparations
now that I know.  I'm leaving it to you,
Roger&mdash;money too, of course, but that doesn't
matter.  It's the house and land that matter.
You'll live there, you and Mary; your children
will be born there, and when you die your son
will have it.  Are you listening Roger dear, do
you understand?"
</p>

<p>
Roger relaxed his attitude of strained attention;
he had caught something of the urgency
of her preoccupation.
</p>

<p>
"I love Lynton," he said simply.  "It will
entirely change my life.  You know I'm not very
happy in my work and living like this, but I can
be absolutely happy at Lynton, and I'll try to
have things exactly as you would like them.  It's
absurd to thank you, Aunt Sarah; Lynton isn't
a Christmas present, but I promise you I'll keep
it up to standard."
</p>

<p>
"It does reassure me to hear you say that,"
Mrs. Greene answered happily, "I know you
love it, Roger, and there will be enough money
to keep it as it ought to be kept."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were vague, her thoughts abstracted
as she brooded over the years during which her
life had been bound up with the life of Lynton.
</p>

<p>
"You know, I've lived there all my life," she
went on, "except for the first three years after I
married.  There was never enough money when
I was a girl; the house got shabbier and shabbier,
and there were only two labourers for the
gardens, and everything was over-grown; even
the lawns had to be scythed and looked like
rough meadows.  And then I married Hugh and
he loved it nearly as much as I did, and even
during the three years when Mamma was still
alive, he spent a little money here, and a little
there, very secretly and carefully so that she
shouldn't guess."
</p>

<p>
"Where were you living then, Aunt Sarah?"
interrupted Roger.
</p>

<p>
"We had taken a house not far from Lynton.
You know it surely; it's called Willowes, only
about two miles the other side of Petworth.  Of
course Hugh came up to town during the week;
he was very busy you know.  Geoffrey had
refused to go into his father's business, so Hugh
stepped into old Mr. Greene's shoes when he
died.  I came up sometimes, but not very often.
Then when Mamma died we went to live at
Lynton of course, and Hugh gave me a free
hand.  I put the house right first; it was the
easiest, but then it took a long time to work up
the gardens, and the lawns didn't come right for
years.  And you see the tenants hadn't had
anything done for them for a long time, so I had
to be very judicious.  The farms needed new
roofs and some wanted new outbuildings, and
the fences and gates were in a shocking state, but
we improved it all slowly."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene fell silent, thinking gratefully
of all that her husband's money had been able
to do for the place she loved.
</p>

<p>
"And now of course it's perfect," said Roger
soberly.
</p>

<p>
She caught eagerly at the word.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think it is perfect, but you know it
would go downhill at once if it wasn't looked
after.  And that's why I'm so glad to have told
you all my affairs.  You see dear, now I can go
over everything with you, and give you all sorts
of details that it would take you some time to
find out for yourself, and so there need be no
hitch later on when you take over."
</p>

<p>
Both were conscious that this was a reminder
of the grim fact underlying the whole conversation,
but to Mrs. Greene it seemed unimportant,
and Roger was enough in tune with her to be
able to concentrate on the one lovely aspect of
the situation.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to go with you to Lynton," he
suggested.
</p>

<p>
"That's exactly what I want.  I feel I must get
back there at once dear.  I can't stay on in town.
But I don't want to hurt Mary's feelings, and I
must come up again next week for Mrs. Rodney's
party.  What is the best thing to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you really want to go at once?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, really at once.  To-morrow if possible&mdash;I
suppose I mean to-day&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A sudden realisation of the time swept over
Mrs. Greene.
</p>

<p>
The stars had faded and a pale dawn was
creeping up the sky.
</p>

<p>
"It's cold," she said, "and it's some absurd
hour in the morning.  We must both go to bed.
I don't know what we've been thinking of; this
is all most unusual."
</p>

<p>
Roger smiled and stood up.
</p>

<p>
"I'm just going," he said, "but first about
plans: We'll tell Mary that you feel it's too
long to stay in town, and that you're going home
to-day, and coming back next week.  And I'll join
you to-morrow, Saturday, and spend Sunday
with you."
</p>

<p>
It was surprising that Roger should take the
initiative to this extent; he seemed suddenly to
have become more mature, more capable, and
Sarah Greene found the effect very restful.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Roger dear, that will be the best
possible plan," she said, enjoying to the full the
rare sensation of being arranged for.
</p>

<p>
She stood up, shivering a little in the cold
morning air.
</p>

<p>
"You've been the greatest comfort to me,"
she said, "and I don't want you to think of this
talk as being at all sad.  It isn't.  Planning for the
future is a very happy thing, and now I'm going
to bed again."
</p>

<p>
Roger kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"Goodnight, my dear," he said.  "Sleep well
till breakfast, and rely on me.  I'll take care of
Lynton for you."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
On Saturday morning a dense pearl-coloured
mist rose about two feet above ground, so that
walking along her familiar paths Sarah Greene
experienced unfamiliar sensations.  Trees and
bushes seemed to balance lightly on the swimming
vapour; the gentle slope up to the garden
assumed a fiercer gradient; everything was wet
to the touch, yet no rain fell.
</p>

<p>
At noon a watery sun gleamed fitfully
through the stationary clouds, but at four o'clock
when Roger drove along the beech avenue only
occasional bare branches were dimly visible, and
when the car turned the last corner he saw that
the lovely sombre house was softly shrouded.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene had spent the afternoon in a
state of unreasonable disappointment.  She knew
that Roger had arrived at Lynton countless times
in the full splendour of sunlight, but she had
determined that this arrival, too, should have the
benison of the sun.  He was not coming this time
only as Roger Dodds; he was coming as owner
of Lynton who must also be lover of Lynton.
</p>

<p>
Proud and confident as she was of the
irreproachable beauty of house and land, she
had nevertheless set her heart on showing them
off to their best advantage at this particular
moment when Roger would be likely to see
them from a new angle.
</p>

<p>
His first words dispelled her anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't this mist beautiful?  I don't think I've
ever seen the house look so lovely and mysterious."
</p>

<p>
"Does it really strike you like that?  I've been
feeling so cross with the weather all afternoon;
I wanted sun for you, but it doesn't matter if
you like this."
</p>

<p>
"I do.  I think it's beautiful," repeated Roger
emphatically.
</p>

<p>
"Come and have tea now," said Mrs. Greene,
"and just tell me when you have to go back to
town so that I can arrange everything to get the
most value from your visit."
</p>

<p>
"I must go to-morrow evening about five, I'm
afraid.  There's a rotten slow train about then
that'll do me quite well."
</p>

<p>
"Is Monday quite impossible?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it is, quite," Roger answered
definitely.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then," said Mrs. Greene.  "After
tea and this evening we'll devote to business.
I'll get out the map of the estate and give you
details about all the tenants and go over the
books with you.  That will leave us free really to
enjoy to-morrow.  I think it will be a lovely day;
it often is after a mist like this, and we'll go for
a long walk and have a late lunch.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like that immensely."
</p>

<p>
"We'll go down the grass walk to the lower
fields where Lynton marches with Hurstfield
and then home through the woods.  And sometime
I want you to talk to Hamilton.  He's an
excellent man and he can help you a great deal.
I'm not quite satisfied with Parks, the second
gardener.  We'll ask Hamilton what he thinks of
him."
</p>

<p>
"I've been thinking a lot about Lynton yesterday
and to-day," said Roger, shyly, "and realising
how much I like every detail.  It's good the
way the house stands four square to the winds,
and I like the Portland stone it's built of.  Really
the exterior is a lovely combination of ornament
and discretion.  It's sound, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"That's exactly what your Uncle Hugh used
to say," answered Mrs. Greene slowly.  "Yes, it's
sound.  Houses are beautifully permanent, aren't
they?  I like to think that stone lasts, just as I
like to remember that the beeches will be better
for your son than they were for my grandfather.
Lynton consolidates itself with every generation."
</p>

<p>
"It's a good point of view," said Roger
soberly.  "You know I like stability and soundness.
I saw so much chaos in the war that I had
a violent reaction in favour of settled traditional
things.  In fact I'm very conventional."
</p>

<p>
"You have to be conventional if you're going
to be at all happy in the country," Mrs. Greene
announced with decision.  "I don't mean because
of the people, though there's that too, of course.
They are much more conventional than in town,
and they'd be disappointed and puzzled if one
didn't do certain conventional things.  But I was
thinking of Nature really.  You'll find that the
land and the woods and the gardens all proceed
along the most orderly and conventional lines.
Really, Roger, there are no surprises, except that
every year I find the first tulips more lovely
than I had remembered.  But nothing bizarre
ever happens.  Things either go smoothly and the
crops are good and the flowers do well, or else
it's warm too early and we get frost in April and
everything is nipped; but either way it goes by
rote."
</p>

<p>
"Every word you say makes me like it
all the more."  Roger's face was serious.  "You
see I'm rather like that myself.  I'm dull;
I've no surprises."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene attacked him hotly in his own
defence.
</p>

<p>
"Really Roger, what nonsense you talk.  It's
ridiculous to say you're dull.  I don't find you so
at all, and you very often surprise me.  I don't
approve of your underrating yourself like that."
</p>

<p>
Roger laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean to underrate myself, but sometimes
I feel I'm a dull dog."
</p>

<p>
"You never need feel that when you're with
me, Roger," said Mrs. Greene, struggling to
express an emotional fact in an unemotional
manner.  "You know how fond I am of you, my
dear boy, and proud of you too.  You touched
me very much by what you said at dinner the
other night about our friendship.  I know it was
quite true and genuine, and the more I think
of it, the more I am glad to think of you and
Mary living here."
</p>

<p>
She stood up abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Come now, let's go and get out the books;
I really have a great deal to tell you."
</p>

<p>
Late that night Sarah Greene drew back the
curtains of her bedroom and looked out over the
wide lawns to the formally cut box hedge
beyond and to the meadows beyond that, sloping
steeply up to the solitary woods.
</p>

<p>
A breeze had sprung up dispelling the mist,
the heaped-up clouds were hurrying across the
dark sky, and the young clear moon was
unrimmed.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow will be a wild and lovely day,"
she said softly, "Lynton will look its best for
Roger."
</p>

<p>
Confident and contented she got into bed and
slept till morning, when she wakened to just
such a day as she had foretold.  White clouds
were still hurrying across the sky, but in between
it was a deep and steady blue.  Leaves were
flying over the lawn; a branch had been blown off
the lime tree near her window and lay untidily
on the path below.  Even the solid hedge yielded
a little this way and that to the contrary wind.
</p>

<p>
It was a sparkling and exhilarating morning.
Sarah Greene and Roger Dodds shared in its
exhilaration as they started out before eleven.
They had made no professions of pleasure
beyond Roger's casual comment, "A lovely day,
isn't it?" as he came in a little late and sat down
to breakfast.  But each was conscious of the
other's happiness, and at times when Mrs. Greene
caught Roger's eye, or saw him lift his
head suddenly intent as a fiercer gust battered
on the windows, she felt that they were
conspirators who shared a secret too exquisite to be
alluded to.
</p>

<p>
This feeling persisted.  Never before had
Roger seemed so responsive.  As they walked at
a good pace down the grass path, his hidden
excitement communicated itself to her, and her
delight was obvious to him.
</p>

<p>
I've never felt like this with anyone but
Hugh, she thought.  It's like a discovery.  I've
never really known Roger before, and now, just
when Lynton and I need him, he suddenly
unfolds.  It's too surprising.
</p>

<p>
A small toad hopped clumsily across their
path; his legs as he took off for each leap
seemed incredibly long, and his protruding eyes
were startled.  They stopped to watch him, and
laughed.
</p>

<p>
Roger, too, was conscious that a marked
change had taken place in their relationship; it
was more alive, and at the same time more
comfortable.  It struck neither of them as strange
that this should be so; everything seemed perfectly
natural to the ill-assorted pair; the small
woman of seventy, pinched, sallow, dressed in
nondescript clothes, but walking bravely in her
sensible shoes, and the tall untidy young man,
with his inexpressive body and face.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene did not attempt to explain to
herself this forward move in their intimacy.  She
accepted it as a belated discovery of Roger's real
quality.  But as they left the grass walk and
trudged through the busy rustling woods, still
not talking, Roger hit on a solution that satisfied
him.
</p>

<p>
It's the link of succession, he decided; there
must be a link of either love or hate between
a person who is going to hand over the thing he
values most highly to someone who values it
too.  And Aunt Sarah has neither hate nor resentment
for me, so that this particular situation
which might be painful is oddly enough quite
easy.
</p>

<p>
"What are you thinking, Roger?" asked Mrs. Greene
suddenly.  He turned his head to smile
down at her.
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking how very comfortable we
were," he answered simply.
</p>

<p>
"I thought that a few minutes ago.  I'm very
comfortable altogether, Roger.  Mary said to me
the other day that she thought I had no worries,
and really, you know, it's perfectly true."
</p>

<p>
"How big exactly is the estate?" asked Roger
inconsequently.
</p>

<p>
"Two thousand, five hundred and thirty-four
acres," Mrs. Greene answered precisely.
</p>

<p>
"That ought to provide you with a worry or
two," suggested Roger.
</p>

<p>
"No, it doesn't.  I have occasional anxieties
but no real worries."
</p>

<p>
They walked on in silence till Roger said
abruptly, "I hate London."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you do; everybody does really,"
answered Mrs. Greene inattentively.
</p>

<p>
Roger laughed and took her arm.
</p>

<p>
"No they don't," he said.  "That's nonsense.
They like it mostly.  They feel safe living in a
sort of rabbit warren.  They'd be terrified if you
set them down in a little cottage in an open
space."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that's true," answered Mrs. Greene,
"but it seems incredible to me.  Aren't
the woods lovely, Roger?"
</p>

<p>
"They're perfectly lovely.  You know I feel
I ought to be asking you all sorts of things but
instead I'm just enjoying myself."
</p>

<p>
"So am I.  I'm very fond of this path; I often
come down it."
</p>

<p>
No faintest tinge of sadness broke their even
happiness though both were thinking of the
many hundreds of times that Mrs. Greene had
walked along the grass path, over the fields and
through the woods, and of the very few more
that would be added to the total.
</p>

<p>
"It's quite dense here, isn't it?" said
Mrs. Greene, "and yet, you know, in a minute we'll
be in the meadow with the house in front of us."
</p>

<p>
"I know; it always comes on you suddenly."
</p>

<p>
As Roger spoke, a turn in the path brought
them out of the wood into full view of the
house.
</p>

<p>
The sun streaming over Lynton turned its
austere grey facade to a mottled richness, and
the leaves of the Virginia creeper that was only
allowed to climb at the south-east corner licked
at the stone like little fiery tongues.  The tall
chimneys, the tall narrow windows, gave to the
sober beauty of the house an airy effect of grace
and lightness that did not mar its steadfast
quality.  Lynton was undoubtedly sound.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene and Roger had stopped at the
edge of the wood.  For a moment the woman
who was about to leave Lynton and the man
who was about to enter it stood together on a
little hill and gazed greedily at it over the
intervening box hedge.  Then they walked on,
through an opening in the hedge, over the lawn,
and in at a side door.
</p>

<p>
"I want to find Hamilton this afternoon,"
said Mrs. Greene after lunch.  "He'll be in one
of two places.  He always is on Sunday afternoons;
either in the wall-garden or the peach-house."
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't he ever take a day off."
</p>

<p>
"No, not really.  Mrs. Hamilton is very
bad-tempered; gardeners' wives are always shrews
you'll find, and he never stays indoors if he can
help it."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if they're shrews because their
husbands are so placid, or if the husbands have
to be placid because the wives are shrews,"
mused Roger.
</p>

<p>
"I can tell you."  Mrs. Greene spoke
decisively.  "All good gardeners have easy-going
temperaments, so they have a fatal attraction
for domineering women.-"
</p>

<p>
"I see.  Hamilton is a good man, isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Excellent; patient and enterprising, the two
best qualities in a gardener.  If you're not tired
we'll go up to the garden now and look for
him."
</p>

<p>
"Surely it's you who should be tired after
such a long walk?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, I'm in quite good training for
walking," answered Mrs. Greene serenely.
</p>

<p>
Hamilton was discovered in the garden, leaning
with folded arms over the back of a seat,
looking gloomily at the bare rose-bushes.
</p>

<p>
"Good afternoon, Ma'am, good afternoon
sir," he said straightening up as Mrs. Greene
and Roger approached.  "This is a real untidy
wind."
</p>

<p>
He frowned disapprovingly and relapsed
again into brooding silence.  Roger looking at the
melancholy face above the white shirt with its
dotted blue stripe and stiff white collar
wondered if Mrs. Hamilton's tongue was the cause
of so much sorrow, or if pessimism as well as
placidity was inherent in the tribe of gardeners.
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to have a chat with you about
Parks," Mrs. Greene was saying.  "Do you feel
quite satisfied with him, Hamilton?"
</p>

<p>
"He does his work well and thoroughly,"
answered Hamilton cautiously.
</p>

<p>
"But apart from that?" questioned Mrs. Greene.
</p>

<p>
Hamilton took off his cap and gently
scratched his head before replying.  Presently he
replaced the cap and pronounced heavily:
</p>

<p>
"The flowers don't like him, Ma'am."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I was afraid of," said Mrs. Greene,
"I don't think they grow for him."
</p>

<p>
Roger felt amazed.  I have an awful lot to
learn, he thought; I never realised that flowers
only grew for people they liked.  I expect
Hamilton will heartily despise me.  On an
impulse of propitiation he ventured to remark:
</p>

<p>
"Surely it's very surprising that flowers
should grow for one person and not another in
the same garden, under the same conditions."
</p>

<p>
Hamilton smiled pityingly and addressed
Mrs. Greene.
</p>

<p>
"It's well seen that Mr. Dodds is not a
countryman," he said.  Then turning to Roger
he added, "Plants are like children, sir; they
need handling.  Ignorant persons or persons who
don't care enough about them can't handle them
proper."
</p>

<p>
Roger was crushed, and at the same time
stimulated at the thought of what lay before
him.  The immediate future was depressing.  He
visualised the grimy badly-lit third-class
carriage, the inexplicable delays characteristic of
Sunday trains, the depressing arrival at Victoria.
But soon there would be no Sunday journeys;
he would come to Lynton to stay.
</p>

<p>
A poignant sorrow filled him at the thought
that Aunt Sarah would not be there to enjoy it
with him; but her calmness, her air of acceptance,
had been infectious.  Roger felt, as she
did, that regrets would be out of place; that
the rounding-off of her life, so nearly complete,
was merely an incident in the continuity of
Lynton.
</p>

<p>
She was still talking about Parks and his
successor.
</p>

<p>
"We'll tell him to look around, then, for a
month or two; there's no immediate hurry,
though I'd like it settled soon.  And in the
meantime I'll ask Lady Langton about that man of
hers who's leaving her."
</p>

<p>
"Parks'll be sorry to leave," said Hamilton
slowly.  "People get attached to Lynton.  There's
something about the place."
</p>

<p>
"There is," answered Mrs. Greene, "there
certainly is.  Well, we must get back to the house
now.  Mr. Dodds is going up to town this evening."
</p>

<p>
"That's a short visit this time, sir," said
Hamilton.  "But then London people move
about more quickly than what we do."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to go," said Roger, anxious to
make it clear that not restlessness but sheer
necessity drove him back to London.  "I'd much
rather stay on here, but I have to get back to
work."
</p>

<p>
Hamilton became a little more cordial.
</p>

<p>
"Well, goodbye, sir," he said, "We'll hope to
see you down again soon," and Roger felt childishly
elated at having wiped out the bad impression
made by his first comment.
</p>

<p>
"He crushed me utterly, Aunt Sarah," he said
as soon as they were out of ear-shot.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene laughed.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Roger, he's always like that.  It's
only his gloomy way of speaking, but I think he
likes you; he often asks after you."
</p>

<p>
"I like him," said Roger, "but he alarms me."
</p>

<p>
"He won't when you know him better; he's
really the mildest creature on the place.  Now we
must hurry back; I want you to have a cup of
tea before you go."
</p>

<p>
"You'll come to us on Thursday, then?"
asked Roger, as the car drove up to take him to
the station.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'd like to do that, but I'll come back
here on Saturday after Edith's party, and you
and Mary will come soon for a long visit, won't
you?"
</p>

<p>
"We'd like to," answered Roger soberly.  "It
would be good for Mary to be in the country
just now, and I'd like to be with you."
</p>

<p>
"I know that, my dear boy&mdash;" Sarah Greene
lifted her face to be kissed&mdash;"And I've had a
delightful twenty-four hours with you."
</p>

<p>
She came to the door with him and stood at
the top of the steps as he got into the car, one
hand resting lightly on the stone balustrade.
</p>

<p>
At the turn of the drive, Roger looked back.
</p>

<p>
The light was failing, and rooks were flying
over the chimneys to reach home before dusk
fell.  Sarah Greene had come down the steps and
was standing, looking up at them with her head
thrown back as they flew over her roof.  She
stood quite motionless and absorbed, and did not
notice when the car turned the corner and was
lost to sight.

MRS. RODNEY GREENE

<h3>
MRS. RODNEY GREENE
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
The birth, growth and development of Edith
Beckett was in the nature of a prolonged prelude
to the life of Edith Greene.
</p>

<p>
She was brought up with but one ideal: to be
a good wife and mother, and to set about being
the first, at least, at as early an age as possible.
This concentration on a single aim amply repaid
itself.
</p>

<p>
When Edith married in 1900 she was equipped
with a complete knowledge of the usual faults
of the young married man, of the dangerous
tendencies which must be nipped in the bud by
his loving and protective wife, and of the special
points which she must remember to keep always
in mind when building up out of the faulty
material to hand a perfect specimen of the genus
"husband."
</p>

<p>
She realised beforehand that even on the
honeymoon a young wife could not afford to
be contented with any lapse from these high
standards which it was her duty to impose upon
the man whom she had honoured with her hand;
one must begin as one meant to go on.
</p>

<p>
In this Spartan mood Edith Beckett steeled
herself to marry Rodney Greene, and it is fair
to say that never once did she fall into the pitiful
weakness of condoning in silence any breach on
Rodney's part, of manners, morals, or good
behaviour.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Their wedding was a successful one.  Edith's
undeniable good looks showed to advantage in
their conventional setting of Chilly white satin,
stiffly wired orange blossom and floating veils.
</p>

<p>
It was generally understood that the young
couple intended to spend their honeymoon on
the Continent, staying the first night at Dover,
but a proper atmosphere of mystification hid
their actual destination.
</p>

<p>
After the last guest had departed, Mrs. Beckett,
subsiding into the nearest chair, indulged
in a few tears of mixed emotion and
fatigue.
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't the dear child looking lovely?" she
said.  "I thought the way she looked up at
Rodney when he put on the ring was just beautiful.
I told her to be sure and look up just then so
that everyone could see her profile, and even in
the midst of all the excitement she didn't
forget."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Beckett sighed contentedly.
</p>

<p>
"Very nice indeed," answered Mr. Beckett.
"In fact it all went very well.  Plenty of
champagne, wasn't there?  I ordered an extra six
dozen to be on the safe side."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said Mrs. Beckett inconsequently.
"Our little Edith's gone now.  They
must be in the train.  I just hope Rodney will
be good enough to her and take care of her."
</p>

<p>
A glimpse into the carriage of the train, rushing
through the flat fields of Kent, would have
reassured Mrs. Beckett.
</p>

<p>
Edith was leaning back restfully, very calm,
very pretty, while Rodney leaned forward from
the seat opposite and kissed her hand devotedly
in the intervals of conversation.
</p>

<p>
"I really think it was a very pretty wedding."  She
spoke with a satisfied intonation.  "Everyone
admired my dress and thought my spray of
flowers much more original than a round
bouquet."
</p>

<p>
"You were wonderful, my darling.  When I
put the ring on and you looked up at me my
heart missed a beat."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Rodney," said Edith affectionately,
but suddenly her face stiffened.  Rodney had
taken out his cigarette case and was actually
lighting a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Surely you aren't going to smoke now,
Rodney," she rebuked him.
</p>

<p>
"Would you rather I didn't?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, much rather.  I don't think this is the
time for smoking."
</p>

<p>
Rodney threw away the cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," he said good-naturedly, "I expect
I can manage to wait till we get to Dover."
</p>

<p>
"You're surely not dependent on a trivial
thing like a cigarette are you?" asked Edith, in
a slightly shocked voice.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am; dreadfully dependent on all
sorts of trivial things.  Cigarettes and you and
good cooking and a glass of port every night."
</p>

<p>
He smiled at her, but her answering smile was
a little formal.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I know you're only teasing, Rodney,
but still there is a certain amount of truth
in what you say.  I've noticed you are apt to rely
too much on things like smoking and port and
so on, and I've always been brought up to
believe that as soon as you feel yourself becoming
a slave to a habit you should drop it at once."
</p>

<p>
Rodney looked blank for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Don't let's bother about that now," he said.
"Bad habits are very pleasant after all, and you
don't want to change me the minute you've
married me, do you?"
</p>

<p>
He spoke lightly, but Edith answered in a
serious vein.
</p>

<p>
"Not all at once, of course, dear, but I do
hope I shall be able to influence you a great
deal."
</p>

<p>
Rodney missed the austere note in her voice,
and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you will," he said enthusiastically.
"You shall influence me as much as you like,
Mrs. Greene.  I love you immensely and you
shall do just what you please."
</p>

<p>
"No, but seriously, Rodney," persisted Edith.
"It isn't a case of doing what I please; we must
try to improve each other.  A marriage where
both people don't improve is a failure."
</p>

<p>
"Darling, you're quoting your mother, and
anyhow it's nonsense," said Rodney.  "Besides I
want to kiss you."
</p>

<p>
The rest of the journey was tranquil, and
in the bustle of sorting our their luggage
at the Station, Rodney forgot to light a
cigarette.  It was with a genuine sigh of relief that
he followed Edith into their bedroom at the
hotel, strode over to the window, drew back the
curtains to look out over the dark harbour and
fumbled again for his cigarette case.  Edith
noticed the gesture.  She came and stood beside
him and gently took the case out of his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Darling Rodney," she said, "I know you
like me always to say what I think, even if it's
a little difficult."
</p>

<p>
She stopped and Rodney flung an arm round
her and said encouragingly:
</p>

<p>
"What is it, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"I must say, Rodney, that it would seem to
me quite wrong and not respectful, for you to
smoke in my bedroom."
</p>

<p>
"But hang it, darling, it's my bedroom, too,"
Rodney expostulated.
</p>

<p>
Edith blushed deeply.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course," she murmured.  "Yes, in a
way it is, but still it wouldn't be quite nice for
you to smoke in it."
</p>

<p>
Her confusion was attractive.  Rodney felt an
ecstatic thrill at the thought that this was the
first time that they had shared a bedroom
together, and he held her to him and kissed her
passionately.
</p>

<p>
But all Edith's rebukes did not lead to
kissing.  When they returned from their
honeymoon Rodney found himself enmeshed in a net
of feminine dislikes, restrictions and vetoes.
</p>

<p>
The details of Edith's campaign for mutual
improvement outlined themselves one by one;
but it struck Rodney as a little hard that on his
side the improvement was to be carried out by
definite acts of self-denial, by giving up old
habits and forming new ones, whereas on
Edith's side apparently the foundation was
perfectly sound, and all that was necessary was to
cultivate virtues already in existence.
</p>

<p>
"You know, Edwin," he said to his brother
one evening, a few months after his marriage
and a few months before Edwin's, "there's a
Hell of a lot of difference between being a
bachelor and a married man.  I never realised
how much I'd have to change.  I used to think I
was pretty harmless, but according to Edith,
I'm a mass of poisonous habits.  Not that she
isn't a wonderful woman," he added loyally,
"clever and capable and all that.  But she
certainly has got a bee in her bonnet about drink
and smoking and language."
</p>

<p>
"Women are like that," said Edwin gloomily.
"You know it's funny how helpless and bullied
Dora used to be, with old Mrs. Pilkington
giving her no end of a bad time, but now they
are running about together as thick as thieves,
choosing the furniture, choosing the house, and
if I happen to suggest anything you may be sure
it doesn't fit in with their scheme."
</p>

<p>
"That's just it.  They've always got a scheme.
Now Edith's scheme is that I should gradually
be weaned away from drink.  You know how
little I drink, Edwin; less than most of the men
I know, but she thinks it's a habit and I'm a slave
to it or something like that, and you know I
believe she'd put one of those stinking pills
they're always advertising into my coffee if
she thought it would make me give up port."
</p>

<p>
Edwin laughed morosely.
</p>

<p>
"I can just see her dropping it in," he said.
"All for your own good, you know, and it pains
her more than you."
</p>

<p>
His face grew serious, and he added rather
diffidently: "I say, Rodney, I haven't had an
awful lot of experience, you know; you might
just tell me, does Edith cry a lot?"
</p>

<p>
"Cry?" repeated Rodney, looking startled.
"Oh, cry.  No, she doesn't.  Why, does Dora?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes she does, rather a lot.  She bursts
into tears pretty easily and takes offence, but then
of course she's always had such a rotten time."
</p>

<p>
"Edith takes offence a good deal, but she
doesn't cry.  It makes her sort of cold and
dignified.  In fact I think she feels she's getting on
with her self-improvement campaign when she
just reasons gently with me instead of getting
angry."
</p>

<p>
Rodney suddenly felt guilty of disloyalty to
his good-looking and adequate wife.  He adopted
the hearty tone of the happily married man and
clapped his brother on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Edith's all right," he said, "and you'll find
Dora'll be all right, too.  Don't worry, Edwin;
things settle themselves nicely."
</p>

<p>
That same evening he took a less optimistic
view.  He was undressing slowly, sitting in his
shirt with one shoe in his hand, luxuriously
enjoying a cigarette, when Edith came into his
dressing-room.
</p>

<p>
"May I come in, darling?" she asked, shutting
the door behind her without waiting for
permission.  Rodney looked with pleasure at the
two long dark plaits falling over her pink
dressing gown, and at the white swansdown lying
softly at the base of her white throat.
</p>

<p>
"Do," he answered heartily.  "Do come and
sit down and talk to me; I know I'm being
slow."
</p>

<p>
Edith bent to kiss him, but drew back with
a look of disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Rodney," she said gently, "smoking
again!  I thought we had arranged that all the
upper part of the house was to be kept free from
the dirt and smell of your cigarettes."
</p>

<p>
"We never arranged anything of the sort.  I
don't bring the dirt and smell as you call it into
your bedroom or the drawing-room, but damn
it, I don't see why I shouldn't occasionally smoke
a cigarette in my own dressing-room."
</p>

<p>
"Just as you please, of course," said Edith
turning away.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go like that," urged Rodney, putting
out the offending cigarette.  "Surely it isn't
worth quarrelling about.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't only that, Rodney," said Edith
gravely.  "It's much more serious and fundamental
than that.  Your language really horrifies
me, it's so terribly coarse."
</p>

<p>
Rodney was aghast.
</p>

<p>
"Coarse," he repeated, "how do you mean,
coarse?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, there you are, darling," said Edith
more kindly.  "You see you don't even know
you've just sworn at me."
</p>

<p>
"I never meant to swear at you, Edith.  I'm
sorry if I did.  But look here, dear, let's just talk
out once and for all, this matter of not smoking
upstairs.  It really is nonsense that I shouldn't
smoke in my own dressing-room."
</p>

<p>
Edith smiled tenderly on him and laid her
hand over his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Don't say any more," she urged, "I don't
want you to have anything to be sorry for
to-night, and I know that what I have to tell you
will make you look at things from my point of
view.  Listen, dear; I came to tell you some
wonderful news: I don't know whether you've
looked ahead or not, and thought about all the
responsibility of having a child, but you'll have
to now, darling; you're going to be a father."
</p>

<p>
Her voice dropped to a reverent whisper as
she added, "It's almost too marvellous to be
true, isn't it, Rodney?"
</p>

<p>
Rodney's feelings were mixed.  His genuine
pleasure at the thought of having a child was
impaired by Edith's manner of imparting the
news to him.  He perceived already that the
child would be used as a goad to further Edith's
schemes for a less easy-going, more disciplined,
habit of life.
</p>

<p>
"I'm very glad," he said heavily.  "Dear
Edith."  But even as he stood up on one
stockinged foot, to kiss her, he thought gloomily
that it was a little hard on him that an
extraneous circumstance should step in and win
Edith's battle for her.
</p>

<p>
"You're really pleased, aren't you?" she
asked, and an unusual note of wistfulness in her
voice banished his resentment.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am, my darling," he said
warmly.  "I'm delighted.  I'll toe the line all
right from now onwards.  You won't catch me
smoking up here again I promise you."
</p>

<p>
Edith unbent completely.  The opposition had
wilted; she could afford to be generous.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest Rodney," she said affectionately,
"you know how much I care for you.  I only
speak about these depressing things because I
feel I ought to.  And now I must go to bed."
</p>

<p>
She disengaged herself gently from his arms,
and moved towards the door.
</p>

<p>
"You'll come at once, won't you?" she said.
"I do get so tired of waiting while you loiter
over your undressing.  Don't be long, dear."
</p>

<p>
She shut the door quietly and Rodney hurried
out of his clothes into pyjamas, determined not
to risk another reproach merely for the pleasure
of ending the day in that atmosphere of contented
leisure which he found so congenial.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
It was three years before Rodney fully appreciated
the fact that providence would always win
Edith's battles for her, and would moreover
give such a twist to her victory that the loser
was often obliged to admit that he had been
wrong.
</p>

<p>
One year after their marriage, when their son
Geoffrey was a few weeks old, Rodney was still
fighting for supremacy in their common life.
</p>

<p>
Edith was slow in recovering her strength;
she was at the stage of having breakfast in bed
and a long rest in the afternoon, and the doctor
advised her to go with the baby for a
change of air.  At this juncture a letter arrived
from Rodney's mother inviting her daughter-in-law
and her new grandson for a long visit,
as soon as they were well enough to face the
journey.
</p>

<p>
Rodney went cheerfully up to his wife's bedroom,
carrying the letter, and sat down on the
edge of her bed.
</p>

<p>
"Here's a letter from Mother," he said.
"She wants you and the boy to go and stay for
as long as you can, just as soon as you are able.
Isn't that nice and convenient?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't quite know," answered Edith
slowly.  "I wonder why she didn't write directly
to me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no special reason; I suppose she just
happened to be writing to me so she asked me to
send you down to her for a bit, and really it fits
in very well; the doctor seems to want you to go
to the country for a week or two."
</p>

<p>
"Oh I see," said Edith, "it's quite a casual
invitation, is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't quite know what you mean by
casual.  You know Mother is awfully keen to
see the baby, and you know she hasn't been well
enough to come to town, so in the circumstances
it seems to me very natural.  Shall I write for
you and say you'll be delighted to go next
week?"
</p>

<p>
"No, don't do that, dear," said Edith firmly.
"I'm not quite sure that it would be the wisest
thing to do.  As you say, your Mother hasn't
been well, and I'm not very strong yet, so it
would really be rather a houseful of invalids."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you need worry about that.
Mother's perfectly all right now; it was only a
sort of serious chill, I believe, and I know she
wants to see the little chap."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course she does," Edith's voice was
rather noticeably patient.  "But I'm really not
convinced that it would be a good thing to go
there now."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Edith," said Rodney, "I don't
know what all this fuss is about; of course it's
the obvious thing to do, but we won't discuss it
now.  There's no need to write to Mother at
once."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Rodney dear," said Edith coldly
and submissively, and the subject was
temporarily closed.
</p>

<p>
That evening Edith developed, along with a
severe headache, a slight rise in temperature.
</p>

<p>
"I think I'd like to ring up the doctor,
Mr. Greene, if you don't mind," said the monthly
nurse.  "Of course baby is three weeks old and
Mrs. Greene is really nearly well again, but still
I don't like her temperature going up."
</p>

<p>
"Please do ring him up, Nurse," urged Rodney.
"It's worrying; I can't think why she should
get a feverish headache like this."
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite understand it either," admitted
the nurse, "Mrs. Greene has been looking
worried and not herself all day, but I know of
nothing to account for it."
</p>

<p>
Rodney's heart sank.  He was oppressed by
grim forebodings, and it was no surprise to him
when the doctor came downstairs after examining
Edith and said to him:
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's nothing much wrong, Mr. Greene;
only a nervous headache and a little
fever, but I'm afraid you'll have to give up this
plan of yours that Mrs. Greene is worrying
herself into fits about."
</p>

<p>
"What plan?" asked Rodney dully.
</p>

<p>
"I understand from Mrs. Greene that you
wanted to rush her down to the country to show
the baby to its grandmother."
</p>

<p>
"That wasn't quite the idea," explained Rodney.
"I understood on the other hand that you
wanted my wife to have a change of air, and my
Mother very kindly asked her to go down to
their place for a bit."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I see.  But I'm afraid it won't quite
do.  Mrs. Greene has worked herself into a state
of nervous excitement about it.  But I shouldn't
worry; there's very often a feeling of strain
between a young woman and her mother-in-law
that works itself out in time, and of course
Mrs. Greene is sensitive and highly strung."
</p>

<p>
"Highly strung?" queried Rodney, "Edith
you mean?  But she's the calmest, most
determined person I've ever seen."
</p>

<p>
The doctor was putting on his gloves.
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," he agreed.  "A splendid patient;
lots of self-control, but very sensitive none the
less, and I think you'll be well advised to give
way to her over this.  Goodnight, Mr. Greene."
</p>

<p>
He hurried out, and Rodney sat down to
write to his mother.
</p>

<p>
While Edith was at Bognor with the nurse
and baby, Mrs. Greene had a second and more
serious attack of pain which proved to be not a
chill, but appendicitis, necessitating an
immediate operation.  Edith's first letter to her
husband was full of sympathy for his anxiety; her
second expressed pleasure at her mother-in-law's
recovery; but on her return she could not
refrain from saying: "And wasn't it a blessing,
darling, that you finally abandoned your
absurd plan of sending us to your Mother for a
rest?"
</p>

<p>
To which Rodney could only answer lamely:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as things turned out I suppose it was
a good thing you didn't go."
</p>

<p>
Two years after their marriage he no longer
attempted to impose his wishes on Edith, but he
still fought to protect his own liberty of action.
In the house, in all matters pertaining to it, and
in the conduct of their joint life, he deferred to
her completely.  He still, however, insisted on
an annual fishing holiday without her, he
frequented his club in spite of her disapproval, and
he was loyal to several friendships which she
deplored.
</p>

<p>
It was over one of these that Providence again
played a hand for Edith.
</p>

<p>
Her opening gambit was tentative.  Rodney
came home one evening with a healthy colour in
his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"There's spring in the air to-night," he said.
"I walked all the way home and it was fine.  By
jove, I'll soon have to begin looking out my rods
if I'm going to get ready for Easter."
</p>

<p>
"You're not going with Jim Turner again
this year, are you?" asked Edith gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I haven't said anything to him lately;
I haven't seen him at the club as a matter of
fact, but of course it's an understood thing
between us that if we can get away, we go off
together in April for a week or so."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think he can possibly expect your
company this year," said Edith firmly.
</p>

<p>
Rodney looked at her cautiously.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why you should say that," he
said, "Of course Jim will be expecting me to
join up with him."
</p>

<p>
Edith plunged into her subject.
</p>

<p>
"Have you considered at all that if you go
away with him it will look as if you approved of
his conduct these last few months."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean," mumbled
Rodney, "I've known old Jim for years, and
he's all right."
</p>

<p>
"But you must know that he's been making
his wife very unhappy all this winter."
</p>

<p>
"I know she makes him pretty unhappy; she's
a hard-mouthed, bitter-looking creature."
</p>

<p>
Edith's colour heightened.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Rodney," she said, "you force me
to be indelicate, and to speak plainly.  Do you
not know that Jim Turner has been behaving
disgracefully with an actress."
</p>

<p>
Rodney looked uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to know anything about his
private affairs," he said.  "Jim's a jolly good
sort anyhow, and, what's more, I'd like to know
how you got hold of all this stuff about him and
his actress."
</p>

<p>
"It's enough that I do know," said Edith
seriously.  "Women are loyal to each other,
Rodney.  I never can understand why people say
we have no sense of honour.  It's really most
unfair.  Women tell each other everything and
help each other whenever they can."
</p>

<p>
"Well I hope to heaven nobody will go bleating
to Mrs. Turner about Jenny Eaves, that's
all," said Rodney.  "Jim's got enough to put up
with already, God knows."
</p>

<p>
Edith was quick to perceive his admission,
but she let the subject drop for the moment.  A
few days later, having cogitated the matter from
various angles, she asked Mrs. Turner to tea
and added mysteriously to her note of invitation,
"I'm anxious to have a little private talk with
you.  There is something I feel you ought to
know, and though it is a difficult topic for me to
touch on, I feel I must make the effort to do
so."
</p>

<p>
In writing this note Edith was actuated by
perfectly pure motives.  Her own words as to the
honourableness of her sex had resounded
pleasantly in her ears.  Thinking the matter over
afterwards it seemed to her no less than her
duty, if rumours were gathering unpleasantly
round Jim Turner's name, to repeat them to his
wife, in order that Mrs. Turner might scotch
them by some decisive action.
</p>

<p>
Only one form of decisive action occurred to
Edith.  She assumed that Mrs. Turner would
behave as she, Edith Greene, would behave in a
similar predicament&mdash;though such a thing was
almost unimaginable.  She would deal
summarily with her husband, pointing out where
his duty lay, and emphasising the necessity for
a clean break from temptation in the form of
the actress, and she would then arrange to be
seen about on good terms with her husband, in
public and at the houses of their various friends.
The whole thing would then blow over, and
Edith Greene decided that in that case Rodney
would not be condoning a moral wrong by going
for his usual holiday with Jim Turner.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Turner came to tea.  She chatted pleasantly
till she had drunk a cup of tea and eaten a
sandwich, and then, laying down her cup, she
came straight to the point.
</p>

<p>
"I think you wanted to speak to me about
something," she said quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I do, Mrs. Turner," answered Edith.  "It is
extremely awkward for me to do so; I don't
even know you very well, but it seemed to me
that as an acquaintance I owed it to you to
repeat to your face what people are saying
behind your back."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Turner stiffened.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," she said.  "And what are people
saying behind my back?"
</p>

<p>
Edith answered courageously.
</p>

<p>
"There is a great deal of gossip centring
round your husband's name," she said.  "You
probably know nothing about it; the wife is
often the last person to hear of these things.
People suspect him of having an affair with an
actress; in fact it is more than a suspicion.  He
has been seen about everywhere with this Miss
Eaves, and my husband says he never even sees
him at lunch at the club nowadays."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Turner rose.  She was pale and her
mouth was drawn into a thin line.
</p>

<p>
"I had no idea of this," she said.  "Thank you,
Mrs. Greene, for telling me so much; I shall
find out the truth and take steps about it at once.
Believe me, I am grateful to you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad you take it like that," said Edith
cordially.  "It was a very painful thing to speak
about, but I felt it was the best thing to do, so I
just took my courage in both hands."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Turner ceremoniously took her leave,
and Edith was conscious of the pleasant feeling
of having carried out well an unpleasant duty,
but the steps taken by Mrs. Turner proved
not to be what she had so confidently anticipated.
</p>

<p>
She heard the results of her well-meant
interference a week later.  Rodney came home
looking depressed, and sat in a glum silence all
evening.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong, Rodney?" asked Edith finally.
</p>

<p>
"Well I saw Jim at the club to-day at lunch,
and there's been a hellish bust up.  It seems some
woman went and told Mrs. Turner about that
affair of his, and she went poking about a bit,
and found out it had been pretty serious and so
on, and now it's all up.  She's left the house,
and she's been to her solicitors and is going to
divorce him.  It's a sickening business; Jim is
very cut up about it all."
</p>

<p>
Rodney smiled bleakly.  "Anyhow you'll be
pleased," he said.  "It puts the lid on our holiday
all right; I don't think I'll go myself now."
</p>

<p>
Edith's eyes had widened with dismay at his
first words, and as he went on her breathing
grew hurried and her lips parted in an expression
of annoyance and perturbation.  She was
sincerely upset.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Rodney," she said, "I'm very sorry
indeed about this, especially as I am the woman
you refer to who spoke to Mrs. Turner."
</p>

<p>
"By God, Edith," said Rodney angrily.
"What the devil did you do that for?  You've
made a frightful mess of things."
</p>

<p>
"Do be calm, Rodney," urged Edith, her
self-possession returning as she prepared to justify
herself.  "I had no option but to speak to
Mrs. Turner.  After all I had heard it would have
been utterly base to have let things slide when a
word might have helped to mend them."
</p>

<p>
"I simply don't understand you Edith;
you're talking like an imbecile.  You've never
liked Jim Turner; you didn't want me to go
away with him; and now that you've succeeded
in putting a spoke in his wheel, you say it would
have been utterly base to do anything else;
you're beyond my understanding."
</p>

<p>
Edith stood up indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"You entirely misjudge me," she said.  "I
acted from the purest motives in doing this very
unpleasant thing, and indeed, Rodney, you
ought to know me well enough to realise that a
petty personal consideration like your going
away with Mr. Turner against my wishes,
would never have influenced me either way."
</p>

<p>
Rodney looked at her; she returned his gaze
steadily, and he knew that she was convinced of
her own sincerity.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," he said heavily.  "I think you
were terribly wrong in what you did, but I know
you meant well."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Rodney," she answered.  "It's
generous of you to admit that at least; and I
should like to say that I'm sorry things have
turned out as they have.  But you know, dear, I
can't help feeling that since Mr. Turner's affair
had apparently gone to such a shocking length,
it is perhaps only right that it should be exposed."
</p>

<p>
Rodney made no answer; he only shrugged
his shoulders and sat staring in front of him, his
drooping attitude indicating acute mental depression.
</p>

<p>
Edith drew up a low chair, sat down beside
him, captured one of his hands and patted it
gently.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry, my dear," she said, "I have a
delightful plan.  Instead of going off by yourself,
why not take me with you this year.  I can
leave Geoffrey with Nurse, and we would
thoroughly enjoy our few days together, just you
and I."
</p>

<p>
Her voice was persuasive, her expression
appealing, and the flickering fire lit up her rich
colouring and wide dark eyes.  Looking at her
clear dark beauty Rodney felt that he could
certainly enjoy a holiday with her and he
pushed away the thought of Jim's betrayal as he
put his arms round her and said enthusiastically,
"I'd like it immensely, darling; we'll go where
you like and when you like."
</p>

<p>
Three years after their marriage he was
surprised to find how easy it was to let Edith
arrange their life and dispose of his leisure as
she pleased.  Her looks were a constant delight
to him; her manner in general was restful, and
their relationship was smooth and effortless so
long as he never opposed her.  On the rare
occasions when he did, he always half expected
some unforeseen hazard to intervene on Edith's
behalf; he had ceased to expect a fair deal.
</p>

<p>
When in 1904 she expressed a desire to move
to a larger house he demurred on the grounds of
expense and ostentation.
</p>

<p>
"I think we owe it to ourselves to have a
better setting now," said Edith.  "And really
dear, you must acknowledge that we can easily
afford it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know about that.  Business
isn't bad of course, but a move is an expensive
thing.  I'd rather leave it for a year or
two."
</p>

<p>
"Now darling, don't be difficult about it,"
said Edith playfully.  "I'm quite determined to
take the house in Sussex Square; it's just right
in every way."
</p>

<p>
"So you've even found the house we're to go
to have you?" asked Rodney a little bitterly.
</p>

<p>
Edith blushed.  "I suppose it is rather tiresome
of me to have chosen it myself, but I do
like to save you worry, dear, and after all the
house is my province and the business yours."
</p>

<p>
She smiled coaxingly, but Rodney shook his
head.
</p>

<p>
"No Edith," he said, "I'm sorry, but I won't
do it this year.  Our income doesn't justify it,
and we'll do very well as we are."
</p>

<p>
"Of course we will if you have quite decided
against a move; you're sure you wouldn't just
like to look at the Sussex Square house?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm quite sure," said Rodney emphatically,
and Edith laughed good-humouredly and only
answered, "Well, that settles it, of course."
</p>

<p>
But a few weeks later she came into his
dressing-room one night and settled herself
comfortably in an armchair.
</p>

<p>
"Rodney dear," she began, "I have something
to tell you.  We're going to have another child,
and I think that really does mean we must move
to the bigger house we were talking of the other
day."
</p>

<p>
Rodney felt a definite sensation of shock as
if some familiar string had been twanged in his
brain.  As he congratulated Edith and expressed
his own gratification his thoughts were racing
madly, but it was not till Edith left the room,
looking back from the door to say with a plaintive
accent, "Do hurry up, darling," that he
remembered the incident of three years ago.
</p>

<p>
It was difficult to imagine that there had ever
been a time when he had smoked upstairs, but
for a moment the parallel stood out sharply;
both occasions had been used by Edith to gain
some small point, and to establish her ascendancy
over him.  As the recollection faded into
dimness he smiled contentedly.  Edith had
consolidated her position as good wife and good
mother, the naturally dominant factor in the
home.
</p>

IV
</p>

<p>
The portrait entitled, "Mrs. Rodney Greene
with Geoffrey, Lavinia and Hugh," exhibited
in the Academy of 1910, was much admired by
the public and favourably commented on by the
Press.  Edith herself, looking at it hung in her
own dining-room after it had been returned
from Burlington House, felt her eyelids prick
with sudden tears at the revelation of her own
triumphant motherhood.
</p>

<p>
She had been painted in a wine-red gown,
sitting in a high-backed chair with her face
turned a little sideways and downwards,
brooding tenderly over Lavinia and Hugh who stood
at her left knee, while her right arm was thrown
affectionately round Geoffrey's shoulders, as if
to compensate for the fact that she had turned
away from where he stood on the right.
</p>

<p>
All three children were in white: Geoffrey
and Hugh in sailor suits, Lavinia in a softly
hanging silk dress.  All three were upright and
dark, with clear soft colour in their cheeks, but
whereas both the boys were gazing out of the
canvas, with serious dreaming faces, Lavinia had
looked up at her mother, and her lips were
parted in a smile over her small first teeth.
</p>

<p>
This happy, unstudied little pose was the
starting point of all Edith's comments on the
portrait, until the day when Mrs. Hugh Greene,
her husband's aunt, came to tea and asked to
have it shown to her.
</p>

<p>
"I only went once to the Academy this summer,"
she explained, "and though of course I
saw the portrait and admired it very much, I
should certainly like to see it again."
</p>

<p>
"It looks very nice in the dining-room,"
Edith answered as they went downstairs.  "In
fact we are extremely pleased with it, though I
think perhaps it flatters me a little."  She laughed
deprecatingly.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think that when I saw it,"
Mrs. Hugh answered simply.  "You are very
good-looking, my dear."
</p>

<p>
At thirty-one Edith Greene was strikingly
handsome.  Tall, robust, but not yet giving the
impression of set solidity that increasingly
marred her looks, she carried herself so well
that the florid fashions of 1910 did not spoil the
lines of her figure.  Her colouring was lovely:
dark hair and dark eyes deepened by the steady,
warm glow in her cheeks; and her features were
well marked but not heavy, though the mouth
was set in lines of command and resolution.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hugh looking at the portrait of Edith
and her children, and then turning to look at
Edith standing by her side, noticed this accent of
command, of over-emphasised self-confidence,
but she only said, "Yes, I think it is an excellent
piece of work."
</p>

<p>
"Of course Lavinia is really the keynote of
the whole thing," Edith began eagerly.  "You
see how she's turned her little head to smile up
at me, and how confident she looks.  That was
quite spontaneous.  She was posed looking straight
ahead like the boys, but at the second sitting she
just put herself like that.  It seemed almost a
tribute to me, Aunt Sarah; it's wonderful when
your child shows its confidence and love."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I see," said Mrs. Hugh.  "Lavinia is
certainly a dear gay little creature."
</p>

<p>
"Would you call her expression gay?" asked
Edith, disappointed.  "It seems much more than
that to me."
</p>

<p>
Mrs Hugh turned to Edith.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she said, "I don't approve of
interfering and giving advice, and I've got no
children of my own, so I'm really not qualified
to speak, but I've sometimes wondered if you're
not perhaps a little greedy with your children."
</p>

<p>
She spoke gently, but the word struck Edith
like a blow.  Her face flushed deeply, but she
answered coldly and politely:
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I quite understand you, Aunt
Sarah."
</p>

<p>
"You're an excellent mother, I know," said
Mrs. Hugh, "And you must just forgive me for
criticising you, but my dear, I think perhaps you
enjoy too much the mere fact of being a mother,
and that is apt to make you expect too much
from your children; not too much affection of
course, but too much faith and admiration."
</p>

<p>
"I think it only natural to encourage my
children to have faith in me."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you do, but let them know you're
fallible, Edith.  It only makes for unhappiness
to bring them up to believe you are always right.
It isn't natural."
</p>

<p>
"I would think it more unnatural if they
didn't trust their mother, Aunt Sarah."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Edith, you don't quite understand
me.  I'm only hoping that on the one hand you'll
let them develop along their own lines, and that
on the other hand you won't take their natural
love for you as anything so important as a
tribute; I think that was the word you used."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it isn't quite easy for us to understand
each other on the subject of my feelings
for my children.  Shall we go upstairs now?"
</p>

<p>
Edith's voice was icy, but Mrs. Hugh was not
daunted by her niece's obvious, though
controlled annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said briskly, "I'm going now.  I
suppose it's only natural you should resent what
I've said, but think it over, Edith; there's
something in it."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Hugh retired in good trim, but Edith
was unable to sooth the sting left by her
criticism.
</p>

<p>
"By the way, Rodney," she began at dinner,
"Aunt Sarah was at tea to-day, and I thought
her manner most odd."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean, 'odd'?  She always seems
to me to be full of common sense."
</p>

<p>
"Well, first of all she asked to see the
portrait, and then quite suddenly she attacked me
about putting myself on a pedestal and expecting
too much from them."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds very unlike her; she doesn't
often butt in."
</p>

<p>
"I certainly consider that she did to-day.  And
as a matter of fact, Rodney, I've thought once
or twice that she and your mother are both a
little sneering and contemptuous about the way I
bring up the children."
</p>

<p>
"Absolute rot I call that.  Mother's simply
devoted to all three of them."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but that's not the point," objected Edith.
"I know she likes the children, but I'm not sure
that she approves of my attitude to them."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know anything about that," said
Rodney uncomfortably.
</p>

<p>
"No, but don't you see it's a little hard on
me?  I have always had such a high ideal of
motherhood.  I've always tried to live up to it,
and I do feel I'm justified so far by the results,
but neither your mother nor your Aunt Sarah
looks at is quite fairly."
</p>

<p>
"I think it's a bit difficult for them to appreciate
all you do for the kids.  Outsiders can only
see that you do rather expect all three of them to
bow down and worship you, don't you Edith?"
</p>

<p>
Rodney's words were softened by his smile,
but Edith's calm was shattered.
</p>

<p>
"You're most unjust," she said hotly and
confusedly.  "I've never had any idea of such a
thing.  It's a ridiculous phrase to use to me,
simply because I hope for a little love and faith
from my children, and because I try to influence
them in what I think is the right direction.  But
you will never take it seriously enough, Rodney;
it's a constant grief to me that you take their
upbringing so lightly."
</p>

<p>
"Now that is unfair, Edith.  I think a lot
about their education, but while they are still in
the nursery they are in your hands.  However,
now the point has arisen I might as well say that
I do think it would be better if you left them
alone a bit more."
</p>

<p>
"Rodney!"  Edith's voice was trembling with
anger.  "What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I think they ought to be allowed to think
things out for themselves sometimes, and not
have to tell you everything and have you discuss
it with them.  Geoffrey especially; he's quite a
big fellow now, he oughtn't to be tied to your
apron-strings any longer."
</p>

<p>
Edith rose and pushed back her chair.
</p>

<p>
"This is really too much," she said passionately.
"First Aunt Sarah, and now you, attacking
the things I hold most dear.  You must excuse
me if I go upstairs; I'm too upset to eat any
more dinner."
</p>

<p>
She left the room, her head held high, and
went up to the day nursery, where Geoffrey was
having his supper, with a book propped up in
front of him.
</p>

<p>
"Darling," she said sweeping in, her pale
frock trailing, "shall I come and sit with you for
a little, while you finish your supper?"
</p>

<p>
As Geoffrey pushed the book away and edged
his cocoa forward, she frowned.
</p>

<p>
"You're not supposed to read at meals, not
even at supper," she said sharply.  "I've told you
that before, haven't I, Geoffrey?"
</p>

<p>
He did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"Darling," she went on, unconsciously introducing
a grieved note into her voice, "you don't
like to vex me I know, but it does vex me
when you go against my wishes, and still
more when you won't admit to me that you are
wrong."
</p>

<p>
"I like reading," said Geoffrey rebelliously,
"and it's only a few minutes anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"But that doesn't make it any less wrong.
You know that, Geoffrey."
</p>

<p>
Again there was no answer, and Edith sighed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what makes you so unresponsive,"
she reproached him.  "It's only this last
few months that you've persistently opposed me.
You used to confide in me and trust me, like
Hugh and Lavinia."
</p>

<p>
"They're only babies," muttered Geoffrey,
awkward and embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that because you're a big boy
and go to school you feel you can't be open with
me any longer?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Geoffrey wearily.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest boy, it's all so simple," Edith
spoke persuasively.  "I must be the judge of what
is best for you; you must remember I'm your
mother."  She drew herself up with dignity, and
went on, "You can surely understand, dear, that
I must know all that my children are doing and
thinking so that I can guide them.  Now tell me
you were wrong, Geoffrey, and hurry into bed."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," said Geoffrey.  "Good-night,
Mother."  He raised his face to be kissed, but
she knew that he had not capitulated; he had
merely eluded her.
</p>

<p>
So far the nursery had not proved as soothing
as she had hoped.  She went into the night
nursery where Lavinia and Hugh were sleeping,
and turned on the light.  Everything was in
order.  A little pile of clothes was neatly folded
on the rush-bottomed, white-painted chair
beside each small bed; the curtains were undrawn;
the window open just enough to make the room
fresh and sweet.  Edith's forehead smoothed
itself as she looked about and was satisfied.  The
small sleepers never stirred; they lay
hygienically without pillows, breathing quite correctly
through their noses.
</p>

<p>
Edith felt reassured and quieted.  She
remembered how difficult it had been for nearly
a year to induce Lavinia to go to sleep without
sucking a thumb, and how she, alone, had
persevered in the attempt to break this habit which
nurse was confident would cure itself in time.
</p>

<p>
This small fact led to a train of thought that
restored her shattered prestige.  She remembered
numberless instances when she had been obliged
to exercise tact and perseverance to eradicate
some budding trait in one or other of the
children.  She had noticed Hugh's adenoids before
the possibility of trouble in the nose had occurred
to nurse.  It was she, and not Rodney who dealt
with Geoffrey's tendency to deceit and subterfuge,
and who was always called upon to arbitrate
in any childish difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Turning off the light she went back to the day
nursery where nurse was sitting darning.
</p>

<p>
"Nurse," she said firmly, "I've said before
that Geoffrey is not to read at supper and
to-night again I found him with a book."
</p>

<p>
"Well he only had one page to finish the
book, Mrs. Greene, so I thought it wouldn't
matter for once."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe in that, Nurse," said Edith
serenely.  "If I make a rule then it is a rule, and
there should be no exceptional cases when you
allow it to be broken."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," said Nurse stiffly, and Edith
went down to the drawing-room where Rodney
was sitting, holding a paper, but looking guiltily
over the top of it at the door, evidently expecting
her entrance.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Rodney," she said, "I have been
very foolish.  It was absurd of me to let myself
be vexed by what you said.  I know very well
that it is only because you cannot possibly enter
into my feelings, that you misunderstand and
misrepresent me."
</p>

<p>
Rodney was at a loss.  He had been prepared
to retract his words but there appeared to be no
need to do so.  They had already been
discounted.  He cleared his throat, trying to
think of an appropriate and inoffensive
reply, but Edith continued her elaborate little
speech.
</p>

<p>
"I ought to realise by now that nobody can
share in a mother's responsibility to her
children; nobody can appreciate her ideals."
</p>

<p>
"Well that's putting it a bit strong, you know;
after all even a mother is a human being," Rodney
spoke with an accent of faint bitterness, but
Edith was unperturbed.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Rodney," she said, "we are a very
happy and united family aren't we?  I've just
been up to the three little people&mdash;Hugh and
Lavinia sleeping so sweetly&mdash;and I feel I need
no reward for all I do for them except the
consciousness that I mean everything to them.
That," she ended nobly, "is all that is necessary
to a good mother."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
As her three children grew older, Edith
consciously and tactfully modified her attitude
towards them.  They had been so accustomed to
deferring to her judgment, they had seen their
father so constantly adopting her views, and
praises of their wonderful mother had rung so
continually in their ears that when Geoffrey was
eighteen, Lavinia sixteen, and Hugh fifteen,
they still kept up the habits of childhood in
never opposing her.
</p>

<p>
She could afford by that time to make a show
of consulting them, to appear to ask their advice,
safe in the conviction that her choice would
ultimately be theirs also.
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey had certainly come through a period
of alienation from her, which had shown itself
in subterranean rebelliousness, and surface
rudeness, but he had not been proof against her two
weapons: the deadly use of personal sorrow,
and a skilful trick of light ridicule.
</p>

<p>
She had seldom been angry with any of the
children; it had been enough to induce into her
face an expression of pain, into her voice a deep
note of suffering, as she said, "Lavinia, dear,"
or "Hugh, dear" as the case might be, "I'm sure
you don't realise how you've wounded me, but
we won't talk of it any more; have it your own
way."
</p>

<p>
Hugh and Lavinia desperately conscious of
having estranged a mother so beneficent that she
would withhold her power and suffer silently,
almost invariably gave in immediately for the
pure pleasure of sunning themselves once again
in her favour.  With Geoffrey during what she
called "his difficult years," it was otherwise.
Sentiment did not move him, but he could not
stand up to her gentle, unerring sarcasm, her
faculty of being always in the right, and smiling
at him as he found himself put in the wrong over
some point on which he was convinced he had
justice on his side.
</p>

<p>
There was one occasion on which Geoffrey
appealed to his father, but Rodney's reply was
final: "Your mother's wishes must be considered,
Geoffrey; I could not go against them and I
can't imagine that you would care to."
</p>

<p>
That ended the matter.  Geoffrey recognised
that his mother had absolute authority over the
household, and as he matured he gradually grew
to recognise too that after all, even if she were
inexorable and unassailable, still, life went
smoothly, and so long as her sway was
unquestioned the family atmosphere was an entirely
happy one.
</p>

<p>
He came near to understanding her attitude
the year he left school and was about to go up
to the University.  It had always been an
understood thing that on leaving Oxford, Geoffrey
should join his father in the engineering works
founded originally by his great-grandfather,
and carried on by his great-uncle Hugh.  A
few months before his first term began Hugh
Greene died suddenly and Rodney Greene
asked his son to enter the firm at once.
</p>

<p>
This was a great delight to Edith.
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy," she said, "I can't tell you
how happy I am that you'll be at home with me
now for a few years.  I know it's a
disappointment to you, but it is a pleasure to your
mother."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you want me to go up to Oxford,
then?" Geoffrey asked.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I did in one way, but now I feel
I'll have three extra years of you, and then later
on when you marry, as I expect you will, I shall
still have Lavinia and Hugh, but now while
they are both away at school I'd have been very
lonely."
</p>

<p>
"I never really thought of that."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you didn't," Edith patted his
hand.  "One's children never do, you know, and
mothers learn to be put on one side without any
fuss."
</p>

<p>
"You know, Mother, sometimes you talk as
if we were frightfully important to you.  Are we
really?"
</p>

<p>
Edith looked astounded.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest Geoffrey," she said at last,
"Your father and you three are all I care about
in life; all I work for and plan for.  Since I
married, my one thought has been to be a good
wife and mother and I think I can say I've
succeeded."
</p>

<p>
She paused, but Geoffrey did not pay her the
expected compliment.  He was frowning over his
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't seem quite sound to me; tell me,
Mother, haven't you ever had anything of your
own in your life?"
</p>

<p>
"But, darling, what could be more my own
than my dear husband and children?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean quite like that.  Father is different,
of course, but take the three of us.  After
all, we've our own lives to lead.  There are all
sorts of things ahead of us, belonging only to
us.  I really meant, haven't you any interests of
your own, intellectual or social or something
quite apart from us?"
</p>

<p>
Edith shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said gravely, "I've never been
either a bluestocking or a frivolous woman.  I
can truthfully say that all my interests are
wrapped up in you four."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds dangerous to me," was Geoffrey's
abrupt comment.
</p>

<p>
"Dangerous, Geoffrey?  My dear boy, you're
all at sea.  When you talk of having things in
the future belonging only to you, it just shows
me how little you understand.  Listen, dear.
You're all three part of me; I've thought about
you and loved you since you were tiny, helpless
babies.  I've watched your characters unfold and
guided you this way and that, and whatever you
do in the future will always belong, in part, to
me.  So long as I live you'll be my little son,
and I'll be sharing your life."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Geoffrey, "It's difficult to
understand how you can feel like that about us, but
anyhow I do see that you feel it."
</p>

<p>
"Wait a few years," Edith smiled.  "When
you're a father you'll understand me better,
though of course," she added, "a mother's
claim is always the greatest."
</p>

<p>
This conversation made a deep impression on
Geoffrey.  He was surprised to find how repugnant
to him was the idea that his life was
inseparably bound up with his mother's, entangled
in her cloying web of affection, hopes and
expectations.  But he realised that he could never
make his feelings clear to her; no words,
however brutal, could establish him as a separate
and independent entity; she would only suffer a
little at the thought that Geoffrey was going
through another of his "difficult times."
</p>

<p>
Determined to spare himself and her that
awkwardness, Geoffrey no longer rebelled
against her gentle interference, but accepted it
pleasantly and then quietly pursued his own
ideas.
</p>

<p>
Lavinia, vivid, sensitive, and almost always
amenable, was the only one who after reaching
years of discretion flamed into open defiance,
and tried to express some of the dumb
imprisoned resentment, that all three felt.
Providence, however, stepped in once more, and won
for Edith so pretty a victory, that in retrospect
the battle-field seemed like a daisied meadow.
</p>

<p>
Lavinia was nineteen, and had been at home
for a year.  The whole affair blew up out of a
chance invitation to a dance, which Edith was
anxious for Lavinia to accept.
</p>

<p>
"I really don't want to go, Mother," she said.
"I don't know them at all, or any of their
friends, and I'll have a rotten time.  They haven't
even asked me to take a partner."
</p>

<p>
"Well, they did ask Geoffrey; it really is
very unfortunate that he has to be away that
night.  But Lavinia dear, you really needn't
worry; I know Lady Olivia quite well, even
though you don't know the family, and I'm
perfectly sure she will see that you have lots of
partners.  Besides it's a nice house for you to
go to."
</p>

<p>
"You don't understand in the least, Mother,"
Lavinia expostulated, "One doesn't go to dances
like that nowadays, to be handed over like a
brown paper parcel, to a different man for every
dance.  If you do go to a party out of your own
set, you must at least take a partner."
</p>

<p>
"You know, dear, you're being a little unreasonable.
I like Lady Olivia and I think this habit
of always dancing with the same few men is
being overdone: I don't approve of it at all.
Now say no more like a good child, I know
you'll enjoy yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I really can't go," repeated Lavinia obstinately.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, dear," said Edith, turning away.
</p>

<p>
The subject was not reopened till the evening
of the dance when Lavinia going up to dress for
dinner found her white chiffon frock and her
white brocade cloak laid out on her bed.  She
rang for the maid whose services she shared with
her mother.
</p>

<p>
"What are these things for, Stacy?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Greene told me you would want your
white dress to-night for the dance, Miss
Lavinia."
</p>

<p>
"What dance, did Mrs. Greene say?"
</p>

<p>
"I think she said it was Lady Olivia Yorke's,
Miss, but I'm not sure."
</p>

<p>
"Oh I see, thank you, that's all right, then."
</p>

<p>
Lavinia's cheeks were scarlet, but her eyes were
stony.  She stood for a moment clutching the
frock in her hot hand, then laid it carefully
back on the bed and went downstairs.
</p>

<p>
On the way she met Rayner, the butler who
had been with them for the last ten years,
coming up.
</p>

<p>
"Would you tell me what time you will need
the car, Miss Lavinia?  Mrs. Greene said you
were going out this evening."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not quite sure, Rayner," Lavinia spoke
steadily, "I'll tell you at dinner.  Has Mother
gone up to dress, yet?"
</p>

<p>
"No Miss, not yet."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Rayner," Lavinia went into the
library where Edith was sitting at her desk, and
quietly closed the door.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," she said seriously, "did you refuse
that invitation for me for Lady Olivia's dance?"
</p>

<p>
"No dear, I accepted it."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence then Lavinia
burst out, "But how could you, Mother?  I said I
wouldn't go.  I told you why; that it would be
hateful and I wouldn't know anyone, and you
said you'd refuse it."
</p>

<p>
"Lavinia dear, I said no such thing."  Edith's
voice was calm.  "I told you I wanted you to go
to it, and you said you were unwilling, but I
explained my reasons, and that surely ended the
matter."
</p>

<p>
She took up her pen again, but Lavinia interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"It didn't end the matter," she said.  "Surely
I have some say in my own life.  It's perfectly
ridiculous, Mother; this isn't the nineteenth
century, and there isn't another girl I know who
can't refuse an invitation if she wants to.  It's
mad, and antediluvian to behave as if I were
two."
</p>

<p>
"You don't know what you're saying," Edith
answered sternly.  "You're speaking rudely and
thoughtlessly.  I expect you to fall in with my
wishes, and I'm very disappointed at this
attitude you've taken up.  Perhaps I've been too
indulgent with you and given way too much."
</p>

<p>
Lavinia laughed wildly.  "Given way," she
repeated, "Oh, no, Mother, you never give way.
The boys and Father and I all knuckle under in
everything; I've never seen it so clearly before,
but it's true what I say, that we aren't allowed
to call our souls our own."
</p>

<p>
"You've said quite enough, Lavinia; I think
you'd better ring up Lady Olivia and say you
aren't very well and had better be at home to-night."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'll go.  I never wanted to go, but I will.
And I'll never be able to forgive you for having
cheated me.  You made me think you had
refused, and all the time you had planned for me
to go."
</p>

<p>
Dinner was a miserable meal.  When Lavinia
had gone to the dance, Rodney came over and
sat on the sofa beside Edith who looked tired
and worn.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong, Edith?" he asked.  "What's
worrying you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm desperately worried, Rodney.  It's
Lavinia.  I do everything I can to amuse the
child, I arrange parties for her, and welcome her
friends here, and now to-night she doesn't feel
quite happy about a dance she is going to, and
she accused me of interfering and deceiving her,
and I don't know what else."
</p>

<p>
"She's spoiled I expect," suggested Rodney
comfortably.  "She's pretty and she's having a
good time and people running after her and her
head is a bit turned, don't you think?  It's natural
to kick over the traces now and again."
</p>

<p>
"No, Rodney, it isn't natural for any child to
speak to her mother as Lavinia spoke to me
to-night.  I was only acting for the best when I
accepted this invitation for her; I like her to get
all the fun she can, but it clashed with some idea
she has in her head, and she simply turned on me."
</p>

<p>
"She'll be sorry when she cools down.  She's
devoted to you, you know, Edith."
</p>

<p>
"I can't believe it now.  I don't feel things
will ever be the same again.  I really am utterly
wretched; in fact I think I'll go up to bed now
if you don't mind."
</p>

<p>
Some hours later Edith was wakened by a
gentle touch.
</p>

<p>
A finger of moonlight lying across the floor,
showed Lavinia in white frock and cloak,
standing by the bed.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," she said urgently, "I'm so sorry
for what I said; I'm glad now that I went,
terribly glad."
</p>

<p>
Edith's sensibilities were fully roused by the
deep, excited note in Lavinia's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Your father's asleep," she whispered.  "I'll
slip out and come up to your room for a minute
or two."
</p>

<p>
Lavinia stole quietly away, and Edith
followed her up to her own bedroom where she
found her sitting on the bed in the dark.
</p>

<p>
"Don't put the light on, Mother," she said.
"I'd rather talk in the dark, and there's a lovely
moon.  You sit down in my chair and I'll curl
up on the bed."
</p>

<p>
"Lavinia dear," said Edith, "I've had a most
miserable evening.  You hurt me very cruelly;
I almost began to feel I had failed with you."
</p>

<p>
"I know, Mother; I'm so sorry."  Lavinia's
voice was dreamy.  "I didn't really mean it, and
it all seems years ago anyhow.  It was
wonderful to-night at the dance.  There was a man
there&mdash;" She stopped, "his name was Martin
Peile," she added in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest," began Edith, but Lavinia's soft
voice hurried on.
</p>

<p>
"Lady Olivia introduced him to me at the
very beginning; there were programmes, and
he asked for the third dance, and then after that
we didn't dance with anyone else; we sat out
together in the little garden.  It wasn't very
cold, and then at the end we danced again
together.  I've fallen in love with him, and he has,
too, with me."  She leaned forward and caught
her mother's hand.  "Isn't it lucky he did," she
said fervently.  "I couldn't have borne to live
another week if he hadn't."
</p>

<p>
"Lavinia, what are you telling me?  My
brain's reeling.  Do you mean what you
say?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh I know it's fearfully sudden.  I didn't
mean to fall in love for years and years.  I know
I'm only nineteen and it must be a shock to you
and all that, but Mother, it really has happened;
I'm engaged to him."
</p>

<p>
"You can't be engaged," said Edith, utterly
bewildered.  "Who is he?  We don't know him or
anything about him.  You're quite wild and
unlike yourself Lavinia, my child."
</p>

<p>
"I know I am; I've never been in love before,
you see."
</p>

<p>
"But really darling, you're going much too
fast.  Things can't be done all in a hurry like
this."
</p>

<p>
Lavinia did not seem to hear.
</p>

<p>
"It's too amazing," she said.  "Mother, I'll
never be able to thank you enough for sending
me to the dance.  I might easily never have met
him.  It's terrible to think I might have gone
on for years and never known Martin.  He says
so too.  He says we'll never be able to be
grateful enough to you.  I told him how dreadful I'd
been, and he is longing to meet you.  In fact he's
coming to-morrow morning.  But really Mother,
I do thank you."
</p>

<p>
Shattered as she was by the thought of the
stranger who had so suddenly entered Lavinia's
life and so entirely absorbed it, Edith nevertheless
tasted to the full the sweetness of her
child's gratitude.
</p>

<p>
"My darling," she said tenderly, "we really
mustn't go too fast, but I want you to know one
thing: Everything I've done has always been in
the hope of giving you happiness, and if this
turns out satisfactorily it will be the most
beautiful thing for me to know that it was I who
brought it about."
</p>

<p>
Lavinia's voice rang with assurance.
</p>

<p>
"It will turn out all right, Mother, there
can't be a hitch or a flaw.  You'll see to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'll see to-morrow," said Edith.  "And
now, dear child, I must go back to your father.
Sleep quietly and well, and don't be excited."
</p>

<p>
She kissed Lavinia and held her face for a
moment between her hands.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a very happy mother," she said, "and a
very proud one, too, to think I've been able to
give you what may very well prove to be the
best thing in your life.  Good-night, and God
bless you."

</p>

<p>
There hung about Dora Greene an atmosphere
of moribundity and stagnation that inevitably
led her relations and acquaintances to classify
her as a bore.
</p>

<p>
Her conversation was monotonous, self-centred,
and wound its interminable way in and
out among the intricacies of her numerous afflictions.
The neglect from which she was convinced
she suffered, the slights she so patiently endured,
and the difficulty of making ends meet on a
reduced income formed the dim tapestry of her
life.
</p>

<p>
The genuinely tragic accident which had
robbed her of her son, lost most of its poignancy
by being endlessly referred to in this ignoble
context, and the one consistently vivid emotion
in her life was her passionate unsleeping
jealousy of her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rodney Greene.
Apart from this and from the frequent scenes
which it occasioned&mdash;scenes of hysterical
reproaches met reasonably though
unsympathetically&mdash;Dora Greene fumbled her way through
each day, accumulating new grievances and
brooding over old ones.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, three times in her life she had
lived purposely and intensely: for half an hour
before her first and only proposal; during the
few months that her husband was at the front;
and for a moment when her son was dying.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Dora Pilkington at twenty-four had been that
pitiful thing, the victim of an ill-natured
mother.  Mrs. Pilkington was obsessed by social
ambitions which had been persistently thwarted;
some at their tenderest stage of growth; some
more cruelly, when they held out promise of
fulfilment.
</p>

<p>
There had been a bazaar; the celebrity
who was to open it failed to arrive.  The
committee approached Mrs. Pilkington, the vicar's
wife, and had in fact asked her to perform the
ceremony, when another member hurrying up
had announced the appearance of a certain lady,
wife of a commercial knight well established in
the county.  With murmurs of "Thank you so
much," and "Then we needn't trouble you
now," the anxious ladies had fluttered away,
intent on higher prey, and the vicar's wife was
left with her words of acceptance bitter on her
lips.
</p>

<p>
Of the multitude of obstacles which nullified
her social projects, the most permanent and
unsurmountable were her own over-zealous
opportunism, her daughter's inertia, and her husband's
earnest single-mindedness.  The Reverend Edward
Pilkington was a man of limited outlook
but sincere purpose.  The country parish in
which he worked, not cognisant of his limitations,
appreciated his sincerity, enjoyed his
ministrations, and made endless demands on his
time and sympathy.
</p>

<p>
For the most part, enjoying his work as he
did and capable of estimating its usefulness,
Edward Pilkington was a happy man.  His home
certainly lacked serenity, but he asked little of
life, and if he was sometimes shamed by his
wife's scornful refusal of invitations, and even
more shamed by her gushing acceptances, still
she was an admirable housewife, and there was
always some sick parishioner to provide a ready
means of escape from her tongue.  When she
saw him adjusting his old scarf, and searching
helplessly for a pair of gloves, Mrs. Pilkington
would raise her eyebrows and enquire acidly:
"What!  Am I to be left again this evening?"  To
which Mr. Pilkington contented himself
by replying vaguely and apologetically:
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid so my dear.  You know a clergyman's
time is not his own."
</p>

<p>
Dora had no means of escape.  She returned
at eighteen from the rather cheap boarding
school where she had spent the last four years,
with a vague idea of helping her mother, being
useful to her father, and ultimately marrying
some delightful and desirable young man.  In
point of fact neither parent required her
assistance, and her mother who had hoped with an
almost savage intensity for a daughter pretty
and clever enough to make a place for herself in
the county, was disappointed by Dora's uncertain
looks and complete lack of initiative.  Gradually
Mrs. Pilkington became so embittered by her
daughter's inadequacy that a stumbling reply,
any manifestation of the gaucherie natural to
unsophisticated eighteen was enough to provoke
an outburst of taunts and ridicule.
</p>

<p>
The reason for this was incomprehensible to
Dora.  She knew only that she was a failure,
and having tried the effect of an incipient
rebellion against her mother in the form of a
muddled and consequently fruitless appeal to
her father, she sank little by little into a state of
apathy.
</p>

<p>
It was in the spring of 1900 when Dora was
twenty-four, that Mrs. Pilkington's hitherto
diffused and generalised unkindness crystallised
into a passionate desire to marry her daughter
with whatever difficulty, to any man, however
unsuitable.  It was intolerable to her to be the
only woman for miles around with a marriageable
and unmarried daughter.  Dora by this time
was conscious of but one wish; to escape as much
as possible from her mother's criticism.  With
this object it was her custom to absent herself for
the greater part of the day on long rambling
walks.  On her return she was always sharply
questioned as to where she had been and whom
she had seen, and the replies, nearly always
unsatisfactory, were greeted with derision and
annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"You've just been wandering about, have you?
You didn't see anyone but old Mr. Crowther
and you didn't speak to him.  I wonder what good
that will do.  You know, Dora, it's all very well
to idle about, but a girl with no looks and no
money can't afford to pick and choose.  You're
not getting any younger, are you?"
</p>

<p>
There was no answer to this type of question.
Dora would mumble something about there
being no one to marry anyhow, and her mother
would take her up.  "Well, there's young
Mr. Lawson at the Bank.  I don't say he's anything
very much, but what do you expect?"
</p>

<p>
"You know he's utterly impossible, Mother,"
replied Dora, her face scarlet with indignation
and embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Dora, I don't really see why you
should look for anything better, and you may
as well know that I'm tired to death of having
you always hanging round the house."
</p>

<p>
"Father doesn't feel like that anyhow,"
retorted Dora, with some courage which was
quelled by her mother's reply.
</p>

<p>
"Your father agrees with me that is a great
pity you are never likely to attract any young
man whom we could welcome as a son-in-law."
</p>

<p>
There were many such conversations, always
ending in a decisive victory for the mother, and in
the daughter's abandonment to resentful tears.
</p>

<p>
In May when Mrs. Pilkington heard that The
Hall, the only large house in their parish, had
been taken by a Mr. and Mrs. Greene with two
grown-up sons, she felt that at last her efforts
must be crowned with success.  The further
discovery that both sons were unmarried lashed her
to an unprecedented exhibition of vulgarity.
</p>

<p>
"That doubles your chances, Dora," she said
triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
Later, when the news filtered through that the
elder son was engaged to a Miss Beckett and
would be married in the autumn, she was
wrought to a pitch of nervous exacerbation that
found vent in threats.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this is the end, Dora.  Unless you
manage to get engaged this summer, something
will have to be done about you in the autumn."
</p>

<p>
Part of Dora's brain registered quite accurately
the baselessness of these threats; she knew
there was nothing that could be done about her,
she knew that her father cared for her, but
something in her cringed at the scope that would be
added to Mrs. Pilkington's insults after a
summer during which she would certainly be thrown
into continual companionship with the younger
Greene boy.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after the Greenes' arrival at the end
of June, Mrs. Pilkington, unaccompanied by
Dora, went up to call at The Hall in order to
review the position.  She found it eminently
satisfactory.  Mrs. Greene was unmistakably a
gentlewoman, and both sons, who appeared at
tea, were good-looking and well-mannered.
Edwin, the younger, was charmingly diffident,
but his face lit up ingenuously when Mrs. Pilkington
replied to a remark of his as to the
scarcity of young people in the neighbourhood:
</p>

<p>
"Why, that's what my young daughter is
always complaining about.  You must meet and
have a good grumble together."
</p>

<p>
"It's selfish of you to complain, Edwin,"
Mrs. Greene interposed briskly.  "You know we've
come here in the hope of your father being able
to get a little peace to finish his book."
</p>

<p>
"Is Mr. Greene an author then?" asked
Mrs. Pilkington, delighted to find that he belonged
to a profession so distinguished, and still more
delighted when she elicited the fact that he was
the Geoffrey Greene whose literary public
consisted of a small but solid body of good opinion,
ready to welcome anything from his pen.
</p>

<p>
"Of course my husband writes mostly essays
and articles," said Mrs. Greene explanatorily,
"but at present he's engaged on something more
ambitious, and he felt it would be a help to get
out of town away from people and things."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," agreed Mrs. Pilkington, "I
quite understand his point of view.  You'll find
this quite a nice quiet neighbourhood, but we
must try and provide a little amusement for your
sons."
</p>

<p>
She smiled at Edwin as she spoke.  Everything
seemed very hopeful to her.  It was obvious
that Edwin was a little bored and restless.  His
work at the Bar was as yet negligible, and the
prospect of three months' idling in the country
was considerably brightened by the thought of
the Pilkington girl who apparently felt as bored
as he did.
</p>

<p>
He accepted eagerly Mrs. Pilkington's invitation
to tennis and supper at the Vicarage a few
days hence, but the elder boy, Rodney, refused.
He was only spending a few days at The Hall
and was then obliged to return to the engineering
works where he was a very junior partner
with his uncle.
</p>

<p>
That evening Dora wandered out into the
garden face to face with a clear-cut issue.  Her
mother's injunctions were perfectly definite;
every effort was to be made to attract Edwin
Greene and if Dora could not succeed in eliciting
a proposal she must at least entrap him into some
unwary declaration which could be taken
advantage of.
</p>

<p>
The sordid meanness of the project was
evident, but Dora Pilkington after six years of
endurance, decided that she was willing to fall in
with any scheme that would lead to freedom
from the incessant taunts and nagging to which
she was subject.
</p>

<p>
As she looked at the moon she thought
vaguely and sentimentally that perhaps he
would fall in love with her, and it would turn
out all right; as she thought of her awkwardness
and badly made clothes, this faint hope died,
and was succeeded by a resolution to capture
by hook or crook the one eligible man
within reach.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon when Edwin came to tennis
was a success.  Dora played passably, and the
only other woman was the doctor's young
wife, absorbed in herself and her husband.
Edwin stayed on to supper, an unusually pleasant
meal at which Mr. Pilkington expanded
conversationally, and Dora and her mother formed
a smiling and apparently harmonious background.
</p>

<p>
It was a lovely night.
</p>

<p>
"Would you two young people like to walk
down to the river?" asked Mrs. Pilkington.
</p>

<p>
"May we?  That would be more than charming,"
answered Edwin, and in a few moments
Dora found herself strolling through the
murmurous summer fields, with a young man saying
to her ardently:
</p>

<p>
"Do let's have a lot of tennis and walks and
picnics, Miss Pilkington; there are so few people
round here that you really must put up with me
a good deal this summer."
</p>

<p>
She felt a strange movement in her blood.  It
was going to be all right then; no need to plot
and plan; she, Dora Pilkington, was embarking
on a genuine romance.  Her heart beat unevenly,
and as she looked at Edwin's young face, clear
and dark in the yellow moonlight, she thought
suddenly: I love him; I'll do anything for him.
</p>

<p>
The days that followed were busy and happy,
but July merged into August and August into
September, and the harvest was stacked in the
fields among the shorn poppies.
</p>

<p>
"Is nothing ever going to happen, Dora?"
asked Mrs. Pilkington, and Dora asked herself
the same question, still more bitterly.
</p>

<p>
Apparently nothing was going to happen.
Edwin Greene enjoyed and sought her
company, but by no word had he ever suggested
that his feelings for her were stronger than
affection and gratitude towards an acquaintance
who was making a dull summer less dull.
</p>

<p>
One Saturday after a particularly trying lunch
alone with her Mother, Dora walked by herself
towards the river where she and Edwin had
gone on that first most hopeful night.  Edwin,
lying in a canoe tethered to an overhanging
tree, saw her white frock coming along the bank
above him.  He felt comfortably lazy and
disinclined to make any move to greet her, but the
disconsolate swing of the hat which she was
carrying in her hand, touched him.  He knew by
this time that the relations between Dora and
her mother were not of the happiest, and he
guessed at the trouble that had marred the
drowsy afternoon.
</p>

<p>
When she drew near to the tree under which
he was lying, he called softly.  Startled, she
looked around in every direction but the right
one, until guided by his laughter she parted the
branches and leaned through, looking down into
the cool gloomy green cavern.
</p>

<p>
Edwin sat up suddenly with a quick intake
of breath as he looked at her face framed by
leaves and twigs that caught at her tumbled fair
hair.  Dora had been crying, she was flushed and
tremulous, but as she looked at Edwin her eyes
brightened and she smiled.  In her dishevelment
she achieved an unusual warm prettiness, heightened
by the contrast between smiling mouth and
tear-stained eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You look simply stunning, Dora," he said
eagerly; "but I can see that something is wrong:
you must let me help you, you really must.  Wait
a minute till I come up beside you."
</p>

<p>
This unprecedented offer of help combined
with Edwin's flattering words and look, broke
down completely Dora's already shaken self-control.
She felt, as on their first walk together,
that strange surging in her veins, and her
response to it was one of courage and sincerity;
virtues as a rule quite alien to her unreliable and
compromising nature.
</p>

<p>
"You can't help me," she said desperately
turning to him with tears streaming unheeded
down her cheeks.  "You mustn't even try; you
of all people must keep clear of me; you don't
understand at all; Mother is determined that
you should marry me."
</p>

<p>
Dora was sobbing loudly and her words were
only spasmodically audible.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know how dreadful Mother is,"
she gasped between sobs.  "She's always going on
at me about you.  You mustn't come and see us
any more; it isn't safe for you; I don't know
what she mayn't do; she's quite set on it."
</p>

<p>
Emotions and ideas were crowding in on
Edwin: surprise, amounting to amazement,
genuine sympathy with the helplessly sobbing
girl, pride at the thought that he and he alone
could turn her misery to bliss, and at the same
time, against these, the urgings of common-sense.
</p>

<p>
He recognised clearly that he was not in love
with Dora Pilkington; he visualised the family
difficulties that must inevitably present
themselves if he adopted the heroic attitude to which
he was drawn.  He had shown no inkling of anything
beyond the most casual affection for Dora;
in conversation he had referred to her as a nice
girl and a good companion, but he knew that his
mother would certainly perceive an engagement
between him and Dora to be the result of some
transitory passion which had led to a declaration.
</p>

<p>
He hesitated, automatically patting Dora's
shoulder with murmurs of sympathetic
encouragement.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she caught his hand, and held it to
her hot wet cheek.
</p>

<p>
"You've been wonderful to me," she said,
"nobody has ever been so kind before, but this
is the end now."
</p>

<p>
This, however, proved not to be true.  At
the unsolicited tribute Edwin's young breast
swelled with the desire to make a heroic gesture.
He thought of the duty that the strong owe to
the weak; visions of gallant men and kneeling
beggar-maids floated cloudily in his brain; he
drew himself up, and strove for his most
resonant chest-notes as he said gravely:
</p>

<p>
"Please don't say anything more, Dora.  You
will make me very happy if you will consent to
be my wife."
</p>

<p>
It was a magnificent gesture and it had its
instant reward.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," cried Dora through her tears, "I
couldn't take advantage of your kindness; you
don't mean it; it's only that you're so good."
</p>

<p>
This protest, these doubts hazarded as to his
resolution, only served to intensify it, the more
so as the sound of his own voice making its
formal proposal had struck chill upon Edwin's
heart.
</p>

<p>
"You wrong me," he protested.  "Indeed I
mean it; it will make me very happy if your
answer is yes."
</p>

<p>
Dora had lived her moment; she had flung
away weapons and armour and renounced her
hopes.  It had been an impulse and she was
incapable of carrying it to a conclusion of sustained
unselfishness.  She knew that Edwin did not love
her and that the whole situation was false and
garish, but the chance was too good to be let
slip.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edwin," she gasped, "indeed it is yes,"
and then relapsed into further sobbing.
</p>

<p>
Edwin too had had his moment, but his was
no isolated detachable fragment of his life.  The
results of it had closed on him like a trap; all
that he could do was to follow up the line of
conduct imposed on him by his own act.  He put
his arm round Dora, and kissed her gently.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," he urged, "don't cry any more.
Please try not to; it does upset me to see
you, and surely everything will be all right
now.  Let's sit down on the bank and discuss
things.
</p>

<p>
"I'm only crying because I'm so happy," said
Dora attempting to dry her tears.  "It's all so
wonderful.  Mother and Father will be so
pleased."
</p>

<p>
Edwin was conscious of a tremor of disgust
at the thought of Mrs. Pilkington, but Dora
seemed to have forgotten the prelude of
frankness which had led to his proposal.
</p>

<p>
"Will Mr. and Mrs. Greene mind your getting
engaged to me?" she asked tentatively, and
Edwin's doubts were lulled by pleasure in her
humility and dependence, and in his own
protectiveness.
</p>

<p>
"They won't interfere," he assured her
stoutly.  "Mother will say I'm too young and we
must wait a little and are we sure we know our
own minds and so on, but Father won't take any
part.  He never does; he says everyone must
buy their own experience."
</p>

<p>
At his own careless words, Edwin again
felt chilled and dismayed; he was buying his
so dear, at the cost perhaps of all his future
happiness.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly in a fever of impatience to make it
irrevocable and be quit of doubts and tremors,
he dragged Dora to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go home at once," he said, "and tell
them we're engaged; let's get all the fuss over
and be married as soon as we can; I'm not earning
any money yet, but I shall soon, and Father
gives me a decent allowance."
</p>

<p>
As they walked back to the Vicarage through
the warm afternoon, Dora thought vaguely of
how crossing these fields an hour ago, she had
been disconsolate, futureless, forlorn.
</p>

<p>
The miseries of her immediate past were
already dimming; her facile and slovenly character
found in her present triumph enough satisfaction
to obscure the legitimate rancour of six
sordid years.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
Shortly after his marriage which took place
in the Spring of 1901, Edwin Greene found that
the qualms which had shaken him at the very
moment of proposing to Dora Pilkington were
amply justified.
</p>

<p>
His father had increased his allowance in
order to make it possible for him to marry and
take a small house while waiting and hoping for
work to materialise.  Dora, who had chosen the
house in Maida Vale, furnished it with the help
of her mother who since the announcement of
the engagement had been her daughter's admirer
and ally, and had thrown herself with zest into
preparations for the wedding.
</p>

<p>
It was an inconvenient little house, made still
more inconvenient by the profusion of small
tables, ornaments and unnecessary objects which
cluttered up the floor space and made it
impossible to cross the room with any ease.  To
Dora these represented the perfection of
gentility; this picture was a signed water colour,
that vase a wedding present from the choir, the
rug in front of the fire superimposed on a larger
rug of different pattern, had come from Dora's
own home which gradually acquired in her mind
an aura of sanctified sentimentality.
</p>

<p>
Three months after her marriage she referred
to "my old home in the country" in such
languishing tones that Edwin, who had been the
easy victim of the old home's cruelty could not
restrain himself, and burst out, "My dear Dora,
for goodness sake don't talk like that; you know
perfectly well you were utterly miserable at
home."
</p>

<p>
Resentful of this plain-speaking, not even
recognising its truth, Dora shed a few tears
through which she contrived to utter: "You do
exaggerate shockingly, Edwin.  I really think
you might try and spare my feelings more."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm sorry, and I don't say it wasn't a
better home than this."
</p>

<p>
Edwin looked gloomily round the crowded
little drawing-room, but Dora immediately
flamed up in its defence.
</p>

<p>
"There you are, criticising again.  You only do
it because Mother and I chose it.  It's a lovely
little house, and I'm sure I take enough trouble
to keep it nice.  Look at the way I dust all the
china myself every morning."
</p>

<p>
Her sobs redoubled in vigour, but Edwin sat
humped up in his chair.
</p>

<p>
He wondered if all young wives cried on an
average three times a day and if all women
twisted every remark into an insult directed
against themselves, their taste, or their relations.
There must be some who don't, he thought
drearily; some women that you can talk to
without having to remember not to say this or that.
Oh well, it's my own fault, I suppose; I must
make the best of it.
</p>

<p>
He got up, came over to where Dora sat, and
awkwardly patted her bowed head.
</p>

<p>
"Don't cry," he said, and even as he said the
words he wondered savagely how often he had
said them since the day of his engagement.  He
pushed the thought away.
</p>

<p>
"Don't cry," he repeated mechanically.  "I
must go and do some work in my study."
</p>

<p>
"But you do like the house?"  Dora looked up
at him plaintively.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do," he answered reassuringly,
and when he stumbled over a footstool on the
way to the door, he put it tidily on one side
instead of kicking it under the nearest table as he
was tempted to do.
</p>

<p>
By 1904, when Dora was expecting her first
child, their positions were reversed.  After one
visit to her sister-in-law's new house in Sussex
Square, Dora came back to Maida Vale
discontented and jealous.  She attacked Edwin that
night after dinner with a complaint which could
not fail to arouse his annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edwin I went to tea with Edith to-day,
and I do think it's dreadfully unfair that she and
Rodney should have so much more money than
we have."
</p>

<p>
Edwin felt completely helpless.  He knew by
this time that if Dora felt a thing to be unfair,
no amount of proof to the contrary would convince
her, but he felt constrained to reason gently
with her petulance which he supposed to be in
part due to her condition.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you see it quite clearly," he
urged, "Rodney and I both have the same allowance
from Father, but for one thing he is three
years older than me, and then being in the Works
with Uncle Hugh he is bound to make more
money than I am at first."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why," said Dora rebelliously.
</p>

<p>
"The Bar's always slow at the beginning,"
explained Edwin.  "You know I've often told
you it may be a long time before I make a decent
income."
</p>

<p>
"It seems very cruel to me," said Dora, her
voice trembling with self-pity.  "Here am I
boxed up in this little house, and there's Edith
with her lovely new drawing-room and two
perfect nurseries."
</p>

<p>
"But I thought you liked this house?" Edwin
was upset at the new development.
</p>

<p>
"I don't; I hate it.  It's a mean little house,
and I know perfectly well that Edith looks down
on it, and me, and you, and everything.  But
there's no use speaking to you; you won't do
anything about it."
</p>

<p>
She left the room, holding her handkerchief
to her eyes in a gesture so familiar that Edwin
did not notice it.
</p>

<p>
He sat still, oppressed by the bitterness of his
thoughts.  All his youthful flamboyance was
gone, and with its going he had gained
immensely in appearance.
</p>

<p>
Edwin Greene at twenty-nine was extremely
good-looking in the austere manner affected by
young barristers.  He looked older than his age
and the lines from nose to mouth were deeply
carved, but the modelling of his face, with its
unmistakable resemblance to his mother, was
excellent.
</p>

<p>
I'm damnably handicapped, he thought, and
there's no way out.  I'm beginning to get on now;
with luck another five or six years will see me
with as much work as I can tackle, but what's the
use of it all?
</p>

<p>
The door opened gently, and Dora came in
and knelt by his side.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edwin, dear," she said.  "I never meant
to get so cross; I am sorry.  But I feel so ill
and miserable these days, and it was just
too much for me to see Edith's beautiful new
house."
</p>

<p>
At the recollection her mouth trembled again,
and Edwin roused himself from his abstraction.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry," he said heavily.  "We'll be
able to have a house like that later on.  But in
the meantime you must try not to make yourself
so wretched over things."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edwin, I do try, but I feel so terribly
ill; you can't possibly understand what I'm
feeling."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure it's perfectly rotten for you, but do
you think you go out enough?  It's supposed to
be good to take a little exercise, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I do go out a little of course, but I really
don't like to be seen very much."
</p>

<p>
"I think that's nonsense, Dora.  Edith tells me
that before her two babies were born she used
to go out every day, and just not think of it,
and she's having another now, isn't she, but she
seems quite bright."
</p>

<p>
Dora's face flamed.  "It's all very well for
Edith," she exclaimed loudly.  "She's got other
nice things to think about, and anyhow she's as
strong as a horse.  But it's very different for
me."
</p>

<p>
She flounced from the room for the second
time, and listening to the sounds overhead,
Edwin judged rightly that this second flight
was final and that she would now withdraw for
the night.
</p>

<p>
Their son, Edwin Pilkington, was born and
lived for the first five years of his life in the
same small house that had provoked so many
battles between his parents.
</p>

<p>
Dora was an injudicious mother, prodigal of
caresses, bribes, scoldings and injunctions.  Nurses
and nursery governesses succeeded each other
so rapidly that the little boy had no sooner got
used to eating, sleeping, and going for walks
with one person than another was immediately
substituted.  This was partly because no one
could put up for long with the suspicions and
jealousies of such an employer and partly
because Dora suffered so intensely when she saw
her son developing any affection for whomsoever
was in charge of him, that she immediately
trumped up some excuse for getting rid of the
interloper.
</p>

<p>
The small Edwin, living in this state of
emotional bewilderment gradually grew to rely on
his quiet and repressed looking father as the one
normal steady person in an otherwise chaotic
existence.
</p>

<p>
Edwin himself who had looked forward
with foreboding to the birth of the child was
surprised and amused when he found what
pleasure he gained from his son's companionship.
</p>

<p>
By 1909 he was a busy man with a steadily
increasing income, and Dora was able to move
to the larger house on which her heart had been
set since Edith's move to Sussex Square.  For a
time she was so happily occupied in furnishing
and decorating that life flowed more evenly for
both husband and son.  The former was spared
anything in the nature of a scene for some
months; days and even weeks went by without
Dora having recourse to her favourite
weapon&mdash;tears&mdash;and the younger Edwin for nearly a
year enjoyed the ministrations of the same
nursery governess.
</p>

<p>
This tranquil state of things was only a lull.
It occurred to Edwin one day that the time had
come for his son's education to begin.  He mooted
the project very tentatively to Dora, hoping that
the idea of looking for a suitable kindergarten
would prove some solace for what he knew she
would regard as a tragic break in her relationship
with the little boy.
</p>

<p>
His hopes were unfounded.  As he mentioned
the word "school," she produced her handkerchief,
and before the end of his sentence she was
sobbing bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"It's the beginning of the end," she wept,
"the beginning of the end.  He'll never be
mine again; once he goes to school he is lost to
me."
</p>

<p>
In vain Edwin pointed out half-jocularly that
it was the inevitable destiny of mothers to lose
their sons in this way; in vain he attempted to
console her by saying it would only be for a few
hours daily.  She was inconsolable.
</p>

<p>
"It's the beginning of the end," she repeated.
"You don't understand how a mother feels, but
at least you might postpone it for a year
or two."
</p>

<p>
But Edwin was determined that some consistent
influence should be brought to bear on
his son's impressionable nature and he persisted.
</p>

<p>
A satisfactory kindergarten was decided on,
and this in turn was succeeded by a day-school.
</p>

<p>
The younger Edwin adapted very easily to
school life, but retained an immense admiration
for his father which at times provoked his
mother to jealous annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"You're silly about your father," she would
say.  "It's all very well for me to take you about
with me, but it isn't manly to hang round your
father as you do."
</p>

<p>
However, Edwin, so easily swayed in many
ways, presented a quietly stubborn front to her
on this point, and continued to seek his father's
company.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1914 when he was nearly
ten, a severe battle raged over his head.
</p>

<p>
He had been entered for a preparatory school
for the Lent Term of 1915, but a vacancy had
unexpectedly occurred and Edwin was anxious
for the boy to take advantage of it and go one
term earlier than had been arranged.
</p>

<p>
Dora set her face against it.
</p>

<p>
"You really are very unreasonable," said
Edwin at last, thoroughly exasperated.
</p>

<p>
"I may or may not be," answered Dora,
always ready to complicate the issue, "But
Edwin's not looked so well lately, and after all
I'm his mother, and I ought to know whether
or not he's ready for a boarding school."
</p>

<p>
"I know he isn't looking too well; that's
another reason why I'm keen for him to start
next term.  He'll be better out of town."
</p>

<p>
"You mean he'll be better away from me?"
asked Dora on that rising note which preceded
a hysterical outburst.
</p>

<p>
"I mean nothing of the sort.  I mean precisely
what I say; that he'll be better out of town,
and I've decided once and for all that he is to
go at the end of these holidays."
</p>

<p>
"So I'm to have no say in it; I'm only his
mother to be pushed aside and ignored."
</p>

<p>
"I'm extremely sorry you take it like this,
Dora, but I'm not open to changing my mind
this time," answered Edwin, and left the house
for Chambers before the storm of tears, which
was the conclusion of all arguments, burst over
the household.
</p>

<p>
The subject was not, however, finally disposed
of till the evening in August when Edwin, who
had felt it impossible to leave London at the
outbreak of war, came home and said rather
abruptly:
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you won't approve of what I've
done, Dora, but I felt I really couldn't keep out
of things so I applied for a commission a few
days ago, and have got it all right."
</p>

<p>
To his surprise, Dora answered quietly: "Oh,
Edwin, that's splendid," and then fell silent.
</p>

<p>
He eyed her distrustfully.  He could have
understood a manifestation of emotional
patriotism that would have culminated in a fit of
sobbing on his breast, or a paroxysm of sentiment
and pride, but what he really expected was an
impassioned reproach for his cruelty and
selfishness in being willing to abandon her.
</p>

<p>
This quietness and restraint was the one attitude
he had not dared to hope for.
</p>

<p>
Dora was obviously making a determined
effort at self-control.  She stood in front of him,
twisting her hands a little, but showing no signs
of hysteria.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad about it," she said at last, "I think
it will be good for us to have a big break like
this.  You know, Edwin, things haven't gone
quite as I meant.  I know I've never really
pleased you and yet I meant to try so hard when
I married you.  But I think perhaps after this it
will be different."
</p>

<p>
Edwin looked at her curiously.
</p>

<p>
"It's been my fault," she continued simply,
"so it's I who must change myself and in the
meantime I'll do all I can to help instead of
hindering."
</p>

<p>
"You've helped me enormously by the way
you've taken this," said Edwin warmly.  "I was
afraid you'd be very upset.  You see, dear&mdash;&mdash;"
he hesitated and then plunged, "I'm afraid it
means I must be off to a training camp the day
after to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Dora's newly discovered composure appeared
unshakable.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have a good deal to do getting you
ready," she said, "but don't worry, we'll manage
all right."
</p>

<p>
Throughout the three months of Edwin's
training in England, even during the trying days
of his last leave, she maintained this admirable
self-command.
</p>

<p>
It lasted indeed until the Spring of 1915
when she received news of Edwin's death.
</p>

<p>
At that her resolution broke.  It seemed to her
that Providence had played her an unwarrantable
trick.  She had vowed to be a different
woman; she had been a different woman, and
this was her reward: that her husband had been
taken from her.
</p>

<p>
She sat looking dumbly at the telegram,
while floods of self-pity rolled over her.
Suddenly she realised that nobody knew yet, that
Mr. and Mrs. Greene and Rodney ought to be
told at once.  At the thought of Rodney working
hard but in safety at his engineering works, she
was suddenly seized by a fervour of hysterical
resentment.
</p>

<p>
Unclenching her damp hands she went to the
telephone and rang up his house.
</p>

<p>
"I want to speak to Mrs. Rodney, please,"
she said, "Mrs. Hugh speaking."
</p>

<p>
In a moment she heard Edith's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Dora, did you want me?"
</p>

<p>
"Edwin's dead," she stated baldly into the
telephone.
</p>

<p>
"What did you say?" asked Mrs. Rodney, for
once at a loss.
</p>

<p>
"Edwin's been killed," said Dora, her voice
rising dangerously.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Dora," she heard, "This is terrible.
I'll come round at once.  I'm dreadfully sorry."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, are you?" shouted Dora, "It's an easy
thing to be.  You've got your husband at home
safely tied to your apron strings.  You can afford
to be sorry for me, can't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Dora," Mrs. Rodney's voice sounded
authoritatively down the wire.  "You must
control yourself.  I'll come round to you at
once."
</p>

<p>
But it was too late to stop the outburst.
</p>

<p>
"Come if you like; I won't see you," Dora
was screaming now.  "You've always done your
best to spite me, and you needn't pretend now
that you've ever cared for Edwin or me.  You've
always had more luck and more money and now
I've lost Edwin too, and I know perfectly well
you think I deserve it, but at least my husband
doesn't hide like a coward in his engineering
works."
</p>

<p>
Her voice died away, as it dawned on her
that Edith had rung off.  She was speaking to
nobody.
</p>

<p>
As she hung up the receiver she caught sight
of the parlourmaid's scared and anxious face
looking over the banisters.
</p>

<p>
"When Mrs. Rodney calls, tell her I can't see
her," she said harshly.  "Mr. Greene's dead; he's
been killed."
</p>

<p>
She pushed past the maid on the stairs, and
burst into her own room, wringing her hands
and crying loudly.
</p>

IV
</p>

<p>
After his father's death young Edwin Greene
found school holidays very trying.  He continued
to miss his father both as an actual presence
and as the restful element in the house, and
he found himself embroiled in a series of
exhausting scenes with his mother.  These scenes
ended in still more exhausting reconciliations,
during which she would hold him, clasped in
her arms while she repeated that she was now a
widow and he her only hope, in accents varying
from the genuinely tearful to the luxuriously
sentimental.
</p>

<p>
The fact that Edwin was only a child of ten
did not deter her from reproaching him bitterly
when he wriggled, embarrassed, from her
embrace, and stood sullenly beside her, anxious
only to get away from an emotional situation
with which he could not cope.
</p>

<p>
Exasperated by what she took to be indifference,
she would stress still further the note of
affection.
</p>

<p>
"You're all I've got now, Edwin, and it
seems as though you don't care about me at all.
Surely you can tell me that you'll love me and
look after me now your father's gone."
</p>

<p>
Shifting his weight from one foot to the
other, staring at the carpet in an agony of uneasy
bewilderment, Edwin would mutter: "Of course
I shall."
</p>

<p>
"Is that all you can say?" Dora would cry,
the familiar note of hysteria creeping into her
voice.  "Leave me then; I'm better alone than
with a son who doesn't love his mother."
</p>

<p>
Guiltily conscious that something was
expected of him, but not knowing what it was,
Edwin would seize his opportunity to escape
from the room, and the whole scene would be
renewed later.
</p>

<p>
In time, however, Dora found it impossible
to feed the flames of despair on Edwin's mute
discomfort, and she resigned herself to a state
of aggrieved self-pity.
</p>

<p>
A year or two after his father's death, Edwin,
who had grown wary and perceptive, realised
that his mother's greatest pleasure in life was to
invite a few women friends to tea, to play
bridge, or to spend the evening, and then to
embark on a prolonged and enjoyable narration
of her grievances; which was sure to be followed
by an equally prolonged recitation of similar
grievances endured by one or other of the ladies
present.  Conversation would continue along
these lines until everyone had exposed to their
satisfaction, the more intimate difficulties,
annoyances and sorrows of their private life.
</p>

<p>
Expressions of sympathy having been exchanged,
the depressing coterie would break up,
to meet again a few days hence and go over the
same ground with undiminished ardour.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion Edwin found himself involved
in a painful scene not only with his
mother, but with one of his mother's friends, a
Mrs. Pratt, whom he instinctively disliked and
distrusted.  It was during the summer holidays
of 1917.  For the last few years the person with
whom he had most in common, apart from his
school-friends, was old Mrs. Greene, his father's
mother.
</p>

<p>
He was invited regularly to spend part of his
holidays with his grandparents in the country,
and the tranquil undisturbed atmosphere of
their house was very welcome to him.  He was
on terms of easy intimacy with both grandparents;
they accepted him unquestioningly
without any of these probing enquiries into the
state of his emotions which made life at
home so difficult for the rapidly developing
boy.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of these holidays he had
already spent a week with Mr. and Mrs. Greene
before going to Bournemouth for a month with
his mother.  But now there still remained a
fortnight before going back to school, and a letter
had come from his grandmother inviting him
to stay again for as long as he could.
</p>

<p>
He opened the subject at breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Dora had been frowning over her newspaper
as he read his letter, and she suddenly burst out:
"Well I must say I don't see why <i>The Times</i>
should report that Rodney and Edith were at
the Ledyard wedding, and leave my name out
of the list.  But some people always manage to
get their name in the papers."
</p>

<p>
Edwin realised that the moment was not
propitious, but his eagerness carried him beyond
the need for discretion.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Mother," he began, "I've got a letter
from Grannie asking me to stay for a bit.  Could
I go to-morrow do you think?  There isn't very
much of the holidays left."
</p>

<p>
Dora put down her paper and looked at him.
</p>

<p>
"You want to go then, Edwin?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather," Edwin assented heartily.  "I'd love it."
</p>

<p>
He stopped dismayed as he saw his mother's
hand grope for her handkerchief, and her face
slowly crumple into misery.
</p>

<p>
"I did enjoy Bournemouth," he began, "but I
just think a little while with Grannie would be
nice."
</p>

<p>
Dora burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edwin," she sobbed, "oh, Edwin.  This
is a terrible blow to me.  You're all I've got,
everything I do is for you, and now you say
you'd rather be with your Grannie than with
me."
</p>

<p>
She sobbed on, as Edwin got up and came
round to her end of the table.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I don't mean that," he said.  "I'm
awfully sorry, Mother; I won't go if you don't
want me to, but of course it would be rather
decent there."
</p>

<p>
"This is my reward.  This is what comes of all
my devotion to you.  Oh, Edwin, I didn't think
you could have hurt me so."
</p>

<p>
"But I've said I won't go.  I can't help
wanting to, but I've said I won't and I don't see why
that hurts you."
</p>

<p>
Dora dried her tears and took his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dear," she said, "you'll never know
what pain a mother feels when her child wants
to leave her.  But when I'm dead you'll be glad
you offered to stay."  She put away her
handkerchief and added heroically.  "You may go,
Edwin; I like you to do what makes you happy."
</p>

<p>
Edwin's face brightened.
</p>

<p>
"May I really, Mother?  Thanks most awfully;
I'd love it.  Do you think I may go
to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
Dora Greene looked pained, but only answered
in a fading voice:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Edwin, you may go to-morrow," and
left the room.
</p>

<p>
Edwin felt a little damped, but when he sat
down to write to Mrs. Greene that he would
arrive the following day, his spirits rose
again.
</p>

<p>
His mother was out for lunch, so he ate it
alone, and afterwards went for a solitary walk,
elated to think that there would be no more
hanging about in London with nothing to do.  The ten
days before school began stretched pleasantly
ahead and as he came quietly into the drawing-room
for tea, his cheeks flushed with walking,
he looked a happy, carefree, small boy.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Pratt was sitting on the sofa beside his
mother.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, Edwin?" she said gravely,
"your poor Mother's just been telling me how
upset she is."
</p>

<p>
Edwin looked both surprised and concerned.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Pratt looked at him reproachfully and
shook her head slowly from side to side as she
said:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edwin.  To think you've forgotten
already how you grieved her this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Don't say anything more," interrupted Dora,
smiling bravely.  "I suppose it is weak of me to
be so hurt, and since Edwin wants to go and
leave me, he must just do it."
</p>

<p>
"Listen to your mother," urged Mrs. Pratt
admiringly.  "Never thinking of herself, always
planning for your happiness, and then see if
you've the heart to go against her wishes."
</p>

<p>
Edwin felt that he had been treated with some
sort of subtle treachery.  His brows were drawn
into a scowl, and he looked sullen and resentful
as he said stubbornly:
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean.  I told Mother
I wouldn't go to Grannie if she didn't want me
to, but she said I might, and I've written and
now I'm going."
</p>

<p>
He half turned away but Mrs. Pratt laid her
hand on his arm as her voice went on gently:
</p>

<p>
"That action was so like your wonderful
mother, dear boy.  You're all she's got and yet
she'll sacrifice herself to let you go if you want.
Now don't you think you could make a little
sacrifice for her and stay at home?"
</p>

<p>
Edwin kicked the leg of the tea table and
fidgeted with his hands, but he did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"You see it's no use," said Dora bitterly.
"He'll do nothing for me; better say no more."
</p>

<p>
She poured out tea, clattering the china in her
nervous annoyance.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Pratt began again:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edwin, dear, I'm sure you don't mean
to be unkind&mdash;&mdash;" but Edwin interrupted her
rudely.  His mouth was shaking, but his voice
was quite steady.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't fair," he said passionately.  "It isn't
fair of Mother to begin at me again.  She
shouldn't have told you anything about it.  I said
I'd do what she wanted, but it was all arranged
that I could go and now she's gone and raked it
all up again with you.  But I'm going all the
same."
</p>

<p>
He stopped confusedly, and became aware of
his mother moaning gently: "Oh, Edwin, oh,
Edwin!"  Mrs. Pratt was repeating in her
amazement.  "Well, I'd never have believed it; I'd
never have believed it."
</p>

<p>
"Believe what you like," Edwin addressed
her distractedly and turned to his mother.
"Don't go on saying 'Oh, Edwin'," he shouted.
"I hate my name; I hate everything."
</p>

<p>
He ran from the drawing-room, and Mrs. Greene
subsided into tears.
</p>

<p>
"My poor Dora," said Mrs. Pratt soothingly.
"My poor, dear Dora, what a terrible afternoon.
I know how sensitive you are, and how you must
suffer from such a scene."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I do.  Nothing could be more unlike
me.  But what can I do?  My son's been taken
from me by his grandmother.  I'm powerless
against her."
</p>

<p>
"It's shocking, really shocking, and especially
when you've got nobody but him."
</p>

<p>
"I've always been lonely; I've had very little
happiness since I was a girl.  When I look back
to my old home and then think of what I've
suffered since I left it, I often wonder I've lived
so long."
</p>

<p>
"You're wonderful, Dora; always so brave,
always putting the best face on things."
</p>

<p>
"I do try," said Dora beginning to brighten,
"But oh how difficult it is when Edwin behaves
to me like this."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you should worry.  I'm sure it
must be Mrs. Greene's influence.  No boy of his
age could possibly behave like that unless his
mind was being poisoned."
</p>

<p>
"Do you really think so?" asked Dora with
interest.
</p>

<p>
"I do," said Mrs. Pratt, dropping her voice
to a mysterious note.  "And I really think you
ought to work out some scheme to prevent it."
</p>

<p>
"But what can I do?"  There was pause, and
then Mrs. Pratt spoke triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"I know, Dora.  I've thought of the very idea.
You must let him go this visit, and then towards
the end of next term you must write and say
you're not at all well, and the doctor is very
anxious about you and says that you must be
spared all worries and troubles."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm quite well," said Dora limply.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course, I know you are, but don't
you see?  It's a real opportunity for you if you
do that.  He can't go and stay with the old woman
if your heart is weak, and gradually you can get
him away from her influence."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do anything for Edwin.  You know that,
Violet.  I'll make any sacrifice for him; anything
to free him from this terrible effect his grannie
is having on him."
</p>

<p>
Dora spoke earnestly, beginning to believe
under the spell of Mrs. Pratt's suggestion that
Mrs. Greene was indeed exercising a malign
influence on her son.
</p>

<p>
The plot to rescue Edwin was gradually
evolved in all its details, but it was never carried
out.
</p>

<p>
Early in November, Dora received a telegram
that sent her straight to Waterloo, and thence&mdash;after
a hideous hour of waiting for a train&mdash;down
to Edwin's school, where she was greeted
by his pale and anxious-looking headmaster.
</p>

<p>
"I have very bad news for you," he said.  "I
find it utterly impossible to express my regrets
and sympathy."
</p>

<p>
"Is Edwin alive?" asked Dora Greene steadily.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he is alive," answered Mr. Foster.
"But the doctor has seen him and the spine is
severely injured.  He is quite unconscious."
</p>

<p>
"Will he live?"
</p>

<p>
Dora Greene, to whom tears came so easily,
was dry-eyed and stony as she asked the
question and listened to the answer.
</p>

<p>
"Only for a few hours.  He may regain
consciousness before the end."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me exactly how it happened, please."
</p>

<p>
"It appears that this morning during the
recreation half-hour, Edwin and another boy
were so foolish as to dare each other to walk
round the gymnasium roof on the coping that
you can see from here."  Mr. Foster moved over
to the window as he spoke.  Mrs. Greene followed
him and stood looking at the long, high
building jutting out from the side of the house.
</p>

<p>
"Is that the coping?" she asked, "where that
bird is?"  A pigeon was walking jerkily along the
narrow ledge, stopping every now and again to
nod its head with meaningless little movements.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's it.  I need hardly tell you that it is
absolutely against the rules to do so, and indeed
no boy has ever before made the attempt.  Edwin
was to go first.  He climbed out through a dormitory
window, up a sloping piece of roof and from
that on to the coping.  He walked quite steadily
the full length of the building, but at the corner
the boys think he looked down and got dizzy.
Anyhow he fell."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Foster stopped for a moment.  His voice
was husky as he continued:
</p>

<p>
"I was there in a few minutes; the matron
too, but he was quite unconscious.  When the
doctor came we moved him into a ground-floor
room, and the doctor fitted up a bed and made
his examination."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Foster looked desperately at the silent
woman confronting him and said again:
</p>

<p>
"I cannot tell you Mrs. Greene, what this
means to me.  It's the most tragic thing that has
happened in all my school career."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see Edwin now, please," said
Mrs. Greene, and was taken to the class-room
where Edwin lay, his eyes closed, his rosy face
pale and drawn, on an improvised bed.
</p>

<p>
The matron who was sitting beside him, rose
and offered her chair to Mrs. Greene who sat
down, still silent.  All through the evening she
sat there, gazing unflinchingly at the small
figure on the bed.  The doctor came in and spoke
to her, but she did not answer.  Food was
brought on a tray, but she refused it.  The matron
sat opposite her on the other side of the bed,
occasionally moving a pillow or bending down to
listen to the child's uncertain breathing.
</p>

<p>
Towards eleven o'clock Edwin's heavy
eyelids lifted and he looked vaguely at his
mother.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know you were here, Mother," he
said uninterestedly.
</p>

<p>
"I've just come to see you, darling," said
Dora Greene stooping to kiss him.
</p>

<p>
"Am I ill?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Edwin, you've had a bad accident."
</p>

<p>
Presently he asked, still passively:
</p>

<p>
"Am I going to die, do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"You've hurt yourself rather badly, dear,"
his mother answered and could not keep a
tremor from her voice.  He lay still with closed
eyes.  At the first sign of consciousness the
matron had hurried from the room.  She now
came back with the doctor, who lifted Edwin's
hand to feel his pulse and then laid it gently
back on the coverlet.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Edwin opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Mother," he said, with more animation
than he had shown, "if I'm going to die, I'd
awfully like to smoke a cigarette first."
</p>

<p>
Dora looked at the doctor, who shook his
head.  She stood up and drew him a little aside.
</p>

<p>
"Give me a cigarette," she said in a savage
undertone.  "Give me one at once; it can make no
difference."
</p>

<p>
"I hardly think&mdash;&mdash;" he began helplessly.
But she interrupted, still in an undertone of
concentrated intensity.
</p>

<p>
"Give me it at once; I insist."
</p>

<p>
The doctor handed her his case.  She took out
a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"There, darling," she said to Edwin, and her
voice was soft again.  "Look, I'll put it in your
mouth for you and light it."
</p>

<p>
The doctor gave her a match and she held the
little flame steadily to Edwin's cigarette.  He
drew in a breath and choked a little.
</p>

<p>
"It's ripping," he said thickly.  "Thanks
awfully, Mother."  His eyelids fell again and the
cigarette dropped from his flaccid lips.  With a
little choking sigh, Edwin Greene died.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene stood still, but in a moment the
doctor took her arm.
</p>

<p>
"He's gone, Mrs. Greene; poor little chap.
Will you come away now?"
</p>

<p>
But with a loud moan Dora Greene fell on
her knees and subsided in a passion of tears over
the body of her son.
</p>

<p>
"He's gone," she cried, "gone, and he never
loved me.  First his father took him from me,
and then his grandmother, and now he's dead
and I'll never have him."
</p>

<p>
For a moment both doctor and matron were
taken aback by the sudden change from rigid
self-control to complete abandon, but as the sobs
turned into laughter and screams, both regained
their composure.  With some difficulty they half
led, half carried, Dora Greene to the school
sanatorium, where she passed the night between
tears, hysteria and passionate vituperations
against the father and grandmother who had
robbed her of her son during his short life.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
V
</p>

<p>
During the next few months Mrs. Pratt
proved herself so willing a confidante, so
soothing and consoling a listener that Dora Greene
finally asked her to come and live with her.
</p>

<p>
The arrangement worked surprisingly well.
Life settled into a routine of gossip, bridge and
tea-parties, broken only by a joint summer
holiday and an occasional week at Easter when
Dora went to stay with her father, now a
widower, but still running his small parish
competently and successfully.
</p>

<p>
It was tacitly understood between the two
ladies that when Mrs. Greene had indulged in a
long narrative embracing every sorrow and
grievance of her existence, she should pay for
the luxury of having an audience by performing
that function in her turn.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Pratt's saga confined itself to full details
of her sufferings at Mr. Pratt's hands during the
months that preceded his departure from this
life in a violent attack of delirium tremens.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene was already acquainted with the
history of Mr. Pratt's life and death, but it made
good hearing none the less, and on the other
hand Mrs. Pratt particularly enjoyed the point
in Mrs. Greene's reminiscences at which
handkerchiefs were brought out, and they recalled
what a happy, bright boy little Edwin had
been.
</p>

<p>
"Those were happy days," Dora would sigh
fondly.  "I was a happy wife and mother till
death stole both my treasures."
</p>

<p>
"But you've been so wonderfully brave,
dear," Mrs. Pratt would murmur.  "See how
you've built up your life again."
</p>

<p>
"I have been lucky in having you to help me.
I couldn't have done it without you, Violet; you
know how little use the Greenes have been to me."
</p>

<p>
This was an immensely satisfactory opening.
Violet Pratt, a solitary woman except for her
friendship with Dora Greene, enjoyed vicariously
the many slights and rebuffs which Dora
considered that she endured from her husband's
relations.
</p>

<p>
By 1928 this list of slights had been added to
by both Mrs. Rodney's daughter-in-laws.  Helen,
Mrs. Geoffrey Greene had failed to call on her
Aunt Dora for nearly two years, and had moreover
never once invited her to a meal of any sort.
</p>

<p>
"Not even tea," said Dora acidly.  "And you
can hardly think that would be too much trouble
even in a small house."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed you can not," Mrs. Pratt answered
warmly.  "And especially after the kind way you
asked her to dinner as a bride."
</p>

<p>
But the most recent insult was naturally the
most interesting.
</p>

<p>
At the wedding of Hugh and Jessica only
three weeks ago, Mrs. Edwin, arriving a little
late when the bride was already in the church,
had been hustled into a back seat instead of being
allowed to take her place in one of the front
pews with the rest of the family.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I don't really blame Jessica," said
Dora, as she had already said some twenty or
thirty times during the last three weeks.  "But
still, it just shows.  Some arrangement should
surely have been made for me to take my proper
place, and even if I was a little late, well, I
haven't a motor like some of the others."
</p>

<p>
"I expect it was all Mrs. Rodney's doing,"
suggested Mrs. Pratt darkly.
</p>

<p>
Dora pounced on this.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really think so?" she asked eagerly.
"Well, I wouldn't be surprised at anything after
the way she has always looked down on me and
put me on one side."
</p>

<p>
It was at this propitious moment that the
maid brought in a letter at which Dora exclaimed
triumphantly:
</p>

<p>
"There now, talk of the Devil&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She read the letter and handed it to Mrs. Pratt.
</p>

<p>
"Read that, Violet," she said.  "Read it and
tell me what you think of it.  I should have
thought that even Edith might have remembered
that next week is the anniversary of little
Edwin's death.  Not the actual day of course, but
I should have thought that a different week
altogether would have shown more courtesy and
consideration.  She knows I always keep these few
days sacred to my memories."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Pratt read the short letter.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
  "207 Sussex Square,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"November 12th.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"DEAR DORA,
</p>

<p>
"I hear that Aunt Sarah is to be in town next
week when Hugh and Jessica get home from
their honeymoon, and I feel it would be nice
both for her and for Mrs. Greene to have a
reunion with the young people.  There are
six of us now, and my idea is to have a little
dinner-party next Friday night at 7.45, for
the six Mrs. Greenes.  I do hope you will be
able to come; both the old ladies are getting
rather frail now, and I think it would give them
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"With love from Rodney and myself,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Your affectionate sister-in-law,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"EDITH GREENE."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mrs. Pratt sniffed.
</p>

<p>
"I see," she said venomously.  "I see,
Mrs. Rodney makes it sound like a treat for her
mother-in-law, but I suppose its just to make
another opportunity for showing off."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is," answered Dora angrily.
"And what a cruel week to choose.  She can't
have forgotten old Mrs. Greene's wickedness to
my poor little Edwin and yet she asks me to
meet her almost on the anniversary of his death.
And I don't at all care about meeting Hugh and
Jessica after the way I was treated at their
wedding."
</p>

<p>
"I should refuse if I were you, Dora."
</p>

<p>
"I've a good mind to do so.  I should have
thought even Edith would have known better
than to ask me to a party next week."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she doesn't mean you to accept."
</p>

<p>
"That's probably it, Violet.  I believe you're
right.  She's chosen that date purposely so that I
shan't go.  Well, she'll be disappointed for once.
I'll go.  I'll write this minute and tell her that
I'll come but that I think she should have known
better than to ask me."
</p>

<p>
Dora Greene moved over to her desk.
</p>

<p>
"Come and help me, Violet," she said.  "We
must concoct a good letter."
</p>

<p>
The two ladies sat happily down to accept
with the maximum of ungraciousness the
invitation which would provide them for weeks to
come with a fruitful topic of discussion and
complaint.

MRS. GEOFFREY H. GREENE
</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>
MRS. GEOFFREY H. GREENE
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
It was at Lavinia's wedding that Geoffrey was
introduced to a tall girl wearing a green frock
and a green hat fitting her head so closely that
only two small curves of bright hair were visible
on her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
She looked moody and impatient, and when he
asked if she had seen the presents she said: "No
thanks, I don't want to."
</p>

<p>
Slightly repelled by her manner but attracted
by her lime green frock and her copper-beech
hair, Geoffrey tried again.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we get out of the crowd and find a
peaceful corner somewhere?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't really think it's worth while,"
she said.  "I'm going home now.  I wouldn't have
come at all if I hadn't been afraid Martin's
parents would be piqued, but now they've both
seen me so I can justifiably escape."
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey noticed that her eyes were a clear,
cool grey that contradicted the warmth of her
hair, and he liked the wide smile that lightened
her face as she explained her presence at the
wedding, so there was a trace of eagerness in his
voice as he asked:
</p>

<p>
"Are you a Peile relation then?  I'm sorry I
didn't hear your name when we were introduced."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm a sort of cousin of Martin.  My
name's Helen Guest.  I didn't hear your name
either, but you're a Greene, of course."
</p>

<p>
"I'm Lavinia's brother."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I thought you were.  You're rather like
her.  She's extremely pretty, isn't she, but not at
all paintable."
</p>

<p>
"Do you paint then?" asked Geoffrey diffidently,
conscious of ignorance and anxious to
avoid a snub.
</p>

<p>
She frowned.  "Well, yes I do; off and on,
and not very well.  But there it is, I do.  I'm going
now.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
Her smile followed quickly on her frown, she
nodded to him, and merged into the crowd,
leaving Geoffrey bewildered and a little
depressed and solitary.
</p>

<p>
Three months later when he met her at dinner
at Lavinia and Martin's house, he went up to
her with the pleasant sensation of renewing an
interrupted friendship.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, Miss Guest," he began.
"I've been hoping to meet you again in some
place not so crowded as the last time."
</p>

<p>
Helen looked at him coldly and directly.
</p>

<p>
"Was there a last time?" she queried.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon?"
</p>

<p>
"I merely said, 'Was there a last time?'" she
repeated in a nonchalant voice.
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey flushed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said very distinctly, and his look
matched hers in coldness.  "We met before at
Lavinia's wedding which you were not enjoying
very much.  You said I was very like my sister
who was pretty but not paintable, and you were
wearing a green frock, very much the colour of
the one you've got on now.  Have I produced
sufficient evidence to prove that I am not trying
the old familiar gambit of 'where have we met
before?'"
</p>

<p>
He noticed that her cheeks were scarlet and
that she was obviously discomfited, and it
surprised him that anyone so aggressive should be
so easily routed.  She stood silent for a moment,
and then laughed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"We're obviously going to quarrel," she said.
"Let's do it nicely; we'll preserve a state of
armed neutrality as long as we can, and when we
have to abandon it we'll keep to all the rules of
pretty fighting, and to begin with I'll admit
that I remember you quite well at the wedding.
I was only being contrary."
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey's heart leapt.  There was something
fresh and vital about this girl.  She provoked him,
but she attracted him far more.  He found it
immensely stimulating to be repelled by her at
one moment, and in the next, subjugated by her
candid charm.
</p>

<p>
He sat opposite her at dinner, and though
she talked animatedly to the man on her left,
her colour remained high and he knew that she
was conscious of him.
</p>

<p>
He speculated hazily on the nature of her
attraction for him and decided that it was partly
due to her looks, partly to her brusque
inconsistency, and that undoubtedly in this strange duel
which had started between them, hers was the
next move.  It was his role to wait and lurk,
hers to make the attack or the appeal.
</p>

<p>
After dinner two tables for bridge were
arranged, with Geoffrey at one, Helen at the
other, and he did not speak to her again until,
after saying good-night to Lavinia, she half-turned
to him, bringing into play the suave clear
line of chin and throat.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take you home if you like," she offered
casually.  "I've got my car here."
</p>

<p>
As Geoffrey thanked her formally he felt that
again she had put him at a disadvantage.  He
should have had a car to take her home in, but
for her to take him, dropping him like a small
boy at his mother's front door, was humiliating.
It irked him to sit idle while she slipped into
the driver's seat and pressed a green slipper
ruthlessly on the starter knob.  There was a
moment of rending noise, then, "Better let me
turn her over once or twice," Geoffrey suggested.
"The engine's bound to be cold if it's been
standing out here all that long time with no rug
on.
</p>

<p>
"I never do put a rug on," Helen looked at
him sidelong.  "If you once begin pampering
your car there's no end to it."
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey burst out laughing.  It re-established
his superiority to find that she could be silly,
petulant and peevish.
</p>

<p>
"I simply don't believe you," he said through
the agonising noise of the self-starter.  "You
forgot I expect, and now you won't admit it."
</p>

<p>
At that minute the engine suddenly jumped
to life, and Helen started the car with a
grinding of gears and a jerk.
</p>

<p>
There was good ground for criticism but
Geoffrey held his peace, and in a moment he
heard her saying: "Do you want to go straight
home or would you like to come to my studio for
a bit?"
</p>

<p>
Surprised, he answered promptly.
</p>

<p>
"The studio most certainly, please."
</p>

<p>
"It's a queer untidy sort of hovel.  Only a
bedroom and a kitchen and a lovely big studio.
I don't live there all the time you see.  In fact
my family kick against my living there at all,
and I have to go home at frequent intervals.  But
when they get too much for me I come and live
in the studio for a few weeks."
</p>

<p>
"Is the family atmosphere particularly trying
then, and is it in London?"
</p>

<p>
"No, and yes.  It is in London, in Lowndes
Square, and it isn't really trying at all.  They're
darlings, but I'm very difficult, you know."
</p>

<p>
"So I should imagine," said Geoffrey softly,
to which Helen only replied:
</p>

<p>
"Do you mind not talking?  I can't cope with
the traffic if I have to concentrate on you."
</p>

<p>
As they drove along the Embankment,
Geoffrey twisted his body into the corner of the car,
to watch her face as she drove.  Even in the cold
yellow light that struck over her as they
approached each lamp-post, and faded so quickly
as they passed it, her colouring disturbed and
troubled him.
</p>

<p>
He wondered if she still had a trace of summer
sunburn, or if all through the winter she
kept that orange glow under her skin, so that it
seemed to be lit from underneath.  Concealed
lighting, he thought vaguely; and very subtle
too.  Much more attractive than pink laid on, or
even pink that looks as if it were the top surface;
this is really orange and pink mixed, and a layer
of skin over it all.
</p>

<p>
He was conscious of his hurried heart-beats
and his thick, hurried breathing when he looked
at the dark-red hair lying so flat on her glowing
cheeks, and when for a second she turned to
him, he found himself completely disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
"We're nearly there," she said.  "It's painfully
conventional to have a studio in Chelsea, but I
couldn't find another that I liked."
</p>

<p>
She ran the car into a garage; they got out,
walked along the road, and turned up a narrow
little alley at the end of which they were
confronted by a blue door.
</p>

<p>
Helen fumbled with her key; the lock was
stiff; impatiently she flung back her dark shawl
and stooped, green-frocked and red-haired,
against the bright blue background.
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey took a step forward.  The juxtaposition
of the three colours was intolerable to his
nerves, already jangled and overstrained.  His
chest was aching, his ears drumming, and just as
the lock yielded he caught Helen in his arms and
kissed her violently and repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he released her and stood on the
threshold feeling cold and sick.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," he said, "I've been unpardonable."
</p>

<p>
"You have," she said.  "Entirely.  I can't
imagine what happened.  Anyhow I think you'd
better go now; everything's sordid and abominable."
</p>

<p>
There was a small red mark at the side of her
mouth.  Geoffrey stared at it stupidly and could
not find anything to say that would not sound
either meaningless or offensive.  Suddenly he was
filled with immense pity for himself and her,
and words came easily.
</p>

<p>
"I've hurt you a little," he said, "I'm sorry,
my dear, but I'm afraid we're bound to hurt each
other, you and I.  I never meant to kiss you; it
was entirely because of the blue door and the
way you stood against it.  It really was too much,
all that blazing blue and green, and your red
hair."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" she asked curiously.
"You can come in for a minute if you like.  I
want to know what you mean when you say it
was the blue door."
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey followed her into the small hall and
through to a big room at the back whose long
windows looked on to a paved garden.  She put
on the light, drew the curtains of some heavy,
dark blue stuff, and knelt down by the fire with
a pair of bellows which she used energetically till
a small flame wavered up from the sullen coal.
</p>

<p>
"There," she said triumphantly.  "That's all
right.  Now, please, talk to me about everything."
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey had stood looking at her as she
coaxed the fire, but he was suddenly
overwhelmed by fatigue.  He sat down.
</p>

<p>
"I feel completely dull and stupid," he said
heavily.  "I can't explain myself at all.  I'm sorry
I offended you."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't be," Helen's voice was light.
"It's all right.  It didn't occur to me that a mere
colour effect would unnerve you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not temperamental as a rule," Geoffrey
said sombrely.  "But I'm conscious of a painful
and lovely tie between us.  It wasn't only the
colour effect; it was dinner and the whole
evening, and driving with you, a frightful strain the
whole time.  Listen, Helen," he leaned forward.
"I've only known you for an hour or two, but do
you think you could marry me sometime.  It
seems idiotic to say I love you, but I do.  I want
to marry you desperately, and do you realise that
for all I know you may be engaged to someone
else."
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey broke off abruptly.  He no longer
felt tired, a deep exhilaration was creeping over
him, and he experienced an almost savage
foretaste of triumph as he said urgently: "Helen,
you will marry me, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
Helen shook her head.  All the colour had
drained slowly from her cheeks, and the little
mark beside her mouth stood out hot and scarlet.
She put a finger up to it and felt it gently.
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered, "I won't marry you,
Geoffrey.  There is a queer link between us.  I
felt it the first minute we met, but I won't marry
you; at least not now.  I might in ten years
if my work fails me, but not now.  You see it is
important to me; I love it, and I feel I'm
going to do something good, and whatever anyone
may say I'm certain it's impossible to work
decently and be married as well."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe it is," said Geoffrey strongly.
"Frankly I've never thought about it, but I'm
perfectly sure we could do it."
</p>

<p>
"No we couldn't; no one can."
</p>

<p>
"Helen, you must marry me.  It seems to me
utterly impossible that you should refuse to.
And that's not conceit, it's simply that I know
we ought to be together, you and I."
</p>

<p>
Helen smiled a little wanly.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think it was conceit, and if I could
marry anyone it would be you, but I can't, don't
you see.  It would be like walking into a cage,
and with my eyes open too.  The minute I got in
and heard the doors shut on me I'd go mad with
terror till I got out again."
</p>

<p>
"You're wrong.  It wouldn't be like that, not
with us, Helen."
</p>

<p>
"It would.  Look at us now, Geoffrey.  A minute
ago you were nearly dead with weariness and I
was bursting with vitality and now I'm nearly
dead, and you're alive again."
</p>

<p>
"My love, that only shows.  Of course now as
things are we fight each other and exhaust each
other, but if we were married, it wouldn't be
like this, we'd both be quite admirably
stimulated all the time."
</p>

<p>
"No, we shouldn't," Helen shook her head
again.  "One of us would be completely on top,
and the other would have to give up everything,
and I might easily be the other!"
</p>

<p>
"That's not fair.  I don't want you to give up
anything; I only want you to marry me."
</p>

<p>
"That's just it, and it's no good," Helen
looked at him levelly.  "I'll be your mistress,
Geoffrey, at least I think I will; not now I
mean,"&mdash;she looked fearfully round the room
as if the shadows might hear and bear witness
against her&mdash;"but sometime I think I will be.
Anyhow I won't marry anyone but you ever,
and you must leave it at that."
</p>

<p>
"My sweet," Geoffrey knelt by her chair and
held her against him, "I don't want a mistress,
and certainly not you.  I want you to marry me,
and you will some day, won't you.  I can wait."
</p>

<p>
Helen freed herself and sat bolt upright.
</p>

<p>
"I love you in a way, Geoffrey, but don't begin
being good to me.  I have people who are good
to me.  If you stop fighting me altogether, I'll
simply trample on you.  I'd hate you to try and
bully me, but I'd hate you still more to be kind
to me."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a very kind person," said Geoffrey
soberly.  "At home I'm supposed to be moody
and difficult&mdash;like you I suppose&mdash;and Hugh is
much more charming and likeable."
</p>

<p>
"That'll do very well then.  I like this feeling
of half loving you and with the other half
being antipathetic to you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like it.  It's hell unless you'll marry
me.  Listen Helen; if we made a treaty with
conditions so that your work was protected, don't
you think you could bring yourself to it then?"
</p>

<p>
"I might; I don't want to; it's against my
better judgment and I'd be a bad wife, but I
might.  Tell me what conditions you'd suggest.
For one thing there's children."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that that matters.  Don't have
them if you don't want them."
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you mind?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not a bit now anyhow.  And if I wanted
one in ten years or so perhaps you might
consider it."
</p>

<p>
"Geoffrey, I almost think we might manage,"
Helen said eagerly.  "I've always ruled
out marriage, and I won't do it at once anyhow,
but if we did really make a sort of treaty that
would safeguard my painting, then perhaps in
two or three years I'd marry you."
</p>

<p>
"I'll work out the clauses.  You'll have to be
protected against me, and against children, and
against my relations, and heaps of other things."
</p>

<p>
"Then why do you want me at all?" Helen
asked in a small voice.
</p>

<p>
"I do.  I want you most painfully.  I hate
your work in a way because it comes between
us, but it's part of you too, and I don't know
you well enough to disassociate bits of you from
other bits."
</p>

<p>
"Don't hate it, Geoffrey.  It's the most
important part of me.  I've not done anything
to matter yet, but I'll show you my last thing
if you like.  I had an idea that all this talk about
schools and styles was nonsense and that one
could paint in two distinct styles in one picture
and still keep the unity."
</p>

<p>
She went over and lifted a canvas that was
turned against the wall.
</p>

<p>
"It's not framed," she said.  "So I'll hold it
up against these curtains; they're a good
background."
</p>

<p>
She held it at arm's length standing very
straight and tall, the outstretched arm and hand
trembling a little with its weight.
</p>

<p>
Two white ponies were coming through a
wood, with a violent sun striking between
the trees.  Each tree was painted as a solemn
dark column with four twisting branches on
each of which hung four formal emerald
leaves.  But the ponies were round and fat,
with flowing manes and tails and little hooves
uplifted.  There was a classical rotundity
about their haunches; their necks were thick
and curved.
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey looked at them and thought how much
happier they would have been frolicking in
some flowery glade, or prancing round a little
copse with a white temple in the centre.  Against
these stark blue-brown trees they became
fantastic: the wood seemed real and permanent,
the ponies&mdash;ironically robust&mdash;were creatures
of an hour, a fashion, a convention.
</p>

<p>
"It's unkind to the ponies," he said, turning
to Helen.  "They're wretched in that wood.
They want to caper in a nice little meadow full
of daisies and buttercups."
</p>

<p>
"Daisies and buttercups," repeated Helen
broodingly.  "Yes, I suppose they do.  Anyhow,
it's no good at all.  I thought I had discovered
something when I began, but half-way through
I lost my idea.  That's why I haven't finished
it.  Perhaps after all I'll marry you and have a
red plush dining-room and hang that over the
mantelpiece."
</p>

<p>
Her voice was sullen, her face pinched and
plain.  Geoffrey was conscious of a profound
and weary melancholy settling on his spirits.
He looked at Helen who returned his look
suspiciously, like a stranger.  Their marriage
seemed remote and improbable.
</p>

<p>
Vaguely he contemplated kissing her, but the
effort was too great in his dazed and empty
state.
</p>

<p>
"I'll ring up," he said disjointedly.  "I must
go now.  Or I'll come and see you; perhaps
Sunday would do, would it?  Anyhow I must go
now; I'm so tired I don't know what I'm
saying."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, come on Sunday.  I'll give you some
supper.  And don't even mention my name to
anyone.  I don't know yet what I'm going to do
about you."
</p>

<p>
Her tone was withdrawn and hostile; it
matched her suspicious glance.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, Helen," said Geoffrey wearily,
and the blue door shut behind him as she said,
"Good-night, Geoffrey Greene."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
Six months of alternating ecstasy and despair
with a persistent undercurrent of nervous
fatigue, so wrought upon Geoffrey's healthy
frame that when he caught influenza in the
spring of 1924, he was seriously ill and
convalescence was long and difficult.
</p>

<p>
The day before he took ill when he was feeling
particularly low and inadequate, Helen had
come to a serious and, she proclaimed, a final
decision.  It coincided with a change in her
method of painting.  She had abandoned the
genre of conventional subjects placed in a
futurist setting of which the two white ponies were
the last example, and had turned instead to
poster painting.  After some months of very
hard work she had succeeded with a design which
momentarily at least, satisfied her exacting
standards.
</p>

<p>
It was austere in line but richly heraldic in
colouring and when she stepped back to look at
the finished work, she decided in one and the
same moment that it was good and that she would
now have to eliminate Geoffrey from her
scheme of life.
</p>

<p>
Her reasons were obscure.  The thought of
doing without him brought with it a faint shock
of surprise and pain, but standing there in front
of her own work it seemed to her impossible to
reconcile anything so simple, so vigorous and
so disciplined, with her passionate and confused
love for Geoffrey.  Her painting was clear and
strenuous; it brought her a few moments of
ease, followed always by dissatisfaction and
renewed efforts, which in their turn brought her
again to a period of content.
</p>

<p>
But there was no such rhythm in her emotional
life.  She loved Geoffrey; at moments
she desired him, and was impatient of the
scruples which constrained him to refuse her as
a mistress; at moments she was conscious of a
surge of tenderness for him which made the
thought of marriage almost attractive.  Often
however, she felt a strong revulsion against him,
not only as an individual, but as an interloper in
her private life who interfered with her peace
of mind and destroyed her powers of concentration.
The only constant factor in their relationship
was her savage determination to protect her
work against him.  This determination showed
itself in a frank and laughing hostility when she
was painting well, and in sullen resentment
when she was painting badly.
</p>

<p>
As she looked at the completed poster Helen
sighed.  Geoffrey must go and the sooner the
better.  It could not fail to be painful to both of
them, but she must feel free again.  She must
disentangle herself from emotional disruptions
and reactions.
</p>

<p>
She rang him up at his office and left a message
asking him to call in the evening, then flung
herself down in a big chair, her hands folded
idly in her lap and an expression of weary
disenchantment on her face.
</p>

<p>
Her thoughts depressed her.  She realised that
apart from all sentimental pangs she would miss
Geoffrey as an irritant.  Already she felt listless
and uninspired at the thought of doing without
him.  He stimulated her, she was goaded to
work by the desire to justify herself for her
refusal to marry him.  Even in her painting she
was beginning to rely on him; a state of dependence
was almost established.
</p>

<p>
She got up impatiently and looked at her
watch.  It was only four o'clock and there was no
possibility of Geoffrey being with her for at
least two hours.
</p>

<p>
Tearing off her painting overall she went
through to her bedroom where she slipped on a
frock of red-brick cr√™pe-de-chine that stole the
colour from her cheeks and dulled her hair to
brown.  She caught sight of herself in the
mirror and told herself defiantly that at times
Helen Guest could look very plain, but when
she had put on a dark coat, and a small dark
hat, she carefully arranged her hair in an exact
semi-circle on either cheek and brushed a little
rouge over her cheek bones.
</p>

<p>
The studio seemed unfriendly as she went
through; the ashes were cold in the grate, the
sun lit up a layer of soft dust over the furniture,
a curtain had torn away from one of its rings
and drooped a little.
</p>

<p>
Helen decided impatiently that when she had
finally broken with Geoffrey it would probably
be better to go home for a time, and shut up the
studio.  A few weeks in Lowndes Square would
effectively drive her to work again.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I'll go and see Lavinia, she
decided; she's a soothing little thing, and the
sight of her house all so smug and correct will
reinforce me against Geoffrey.  It's the sort of
house and life I'd fall into if I were such a fool
as to marry him.  She shrugged at her own
weakness in needing reinforcements and set out
briskly for Lavinia's house in Catherine Street.
</p>

<p>
It happened that Mrs. Rodney Greene was
having tea with her daughter when Helen was
announced.
</p>

<p>
Lavinia greeted Helen affectionately, and
turned to her mother.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you've met Helen, Mother
dear," she said.  "Unless perhaps for a moment
at the wedding, but that hardly counts."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think I have," answered
Mrs. Rodney.  "But I know you're a relation of
Martin's, Miss Guest.  I've often heard both him
and Lavinia talking of your work.  You paint,
don't you?"
</p>

<p>
Her voice was pleasant, but her eye raked
Helen from her long legs to the jaunty little
hat that covered her eyebrows and it registered
unmistakable disapproval.
</p>

<p>
"I've just finished a thing to-day, but I feel
I'll never paint again," said Helen, and though
her voice was low there was a violence behind
the words that struck unpleasantly on Mrs. Rodney's
ears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but surely you won't give up like that,"
she began persuasively.  "Of course I can understand
artistic discouragement; the finished work
falling so far short of the ideal"&mdash;she sketched
a vague gesture in the air&mdash;"But still I'm sure
you should persevere."
</p>

<p>
She looked brightly and expectantly at Helen
but her glib words of consolation fell on a grim
silence.  Helen lay back wearily in her chair
hardly seeming to hear what was said, and it
was Lavinia who answered rather awkwardly:
"Helen paints beautifully, Mother.  She did a
picture of some ponies a little while ago that
you would simply love."
</p>

<p>
"Oh Lavinia, that thing's no good at all,"
said Helen impatiently.  "It's absolutely wrong;
the idea was wrong to begin with, and then I
didn't even carry it out properly.  What I'm
doing now is quite different," she leaned
forward, eager and unselfconscious, "I think I've
discovered at last what I want to do; not
impressionistic at all, purely decorative and very
severe and simple.  I really believe it's a style
I can express myself in."
</p>

<p>
She caught Mrs. Rodney's blank expression
and relapsed into silence.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm glad to know you're not really
giving it up," said Mrs. Rodney, kindly.  "But
now I must be going, Lavinia, dear; I've got
some shopping to do on the way home."  Mrs. Greene
stood up.  "Good-bye, Miss Guest," she
said.  "Perhaps Lavinia will bring you to tea with
me one day.  I should enjoy a little talk about
art."
</p>

<p>
Helen winced visibly, but her voice was polite
and non-committal as she said: "Thank you,
Mrs. Greene, it's very good of you.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mind if I go down with Mother; I
won't be a minute?" asked Lavinia.
</p>

<p>
She left the room, forgetting to close the
door, and presently Mrs. Rodney's clear voice
floated up from the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Well, come and see us soon, darling, won't
you?  And tell me, do you see much of that Miss
Guest?  I think she's a very exaggerated young
woman, and her manner struck me as most
unfortunate."
</p>

<p>
"We like her very much," Lavinia answered
simply.  "And she's awfully clever."
</p>

<p>
"I must say I don't think mere cleverness is
enough to excuse such brusque behaviour.  Good-bye,
dear; take care of yourself."
</p>

<p>
The front door closed, and Lavinia came
upstairs and into the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Helen looked at her and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you like me," she said.  "But your
Mother's perfectly right.  I'm not nearly clever
enough to justify my brusque behaviour, and
from her point of view my manner is undoubtedly
unfortunate."
</p>

<p>
Lavinia flushed.  "I'm sorry you heard," she
said.  "Mother is very critical, but she would like
you if she knew you properly."
</p>

<p>
"No she wouldn't.  It's inconceivable that she
could ever like me.  Not in a thousand years.  But
I'm sorry I burst in on you and her like that.  I
was in a bad mood and thought I'd come and
look at you and your house and profit by its
example."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean anything at all nice, so let's
leave it at that.  You're looking very pretty
Lavinia; the baby hasn't even begun to spoil
your looks yet."
</p>

<p>
"It will soon, I'm afraid.  I look horribly
black under the eyes in the morning.  I only begin
to get human about midday."
</p>

<p>
"You really are extremely like Geoffrey."
Helen spoke abruptly.  "Lavinia, do you know
I've been treating him abominably."
</p>

<p>
"No, I didn't know that.  I'm sorry.  Geoffrey
is a dear really; I'm awfully fond of him."
</p>

<p>
"So am I.  I love him in a way but I can't
marry him.  I can't face being stuck down in a
little house and having to run it and be amiable
at breakfast and welcome my husband's friends
and be polite to his relations.  I simply can't do
it."
</p>

<p>
"Can't you really, Helen?  Geoffrey hasn't
told me anything about it, but I know he's been
miserable about something for months, and I
did just think once from something he said,
that it might be because of you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's no good anyhow.  I'm not going to
see him any more after this evening.  I do think
anything's better than dragging on like this."
</p>

<p>
"You know, Helen, I honestly think you
wouldn't find it so very difficult to be married.
You'd be quite rich.  You've got some money of
your own, and Geoffrey isn't doing so badly;
he went into the business very young, so you
could have decent maids, who would run the
house for you.  It makes all the difference if you
have enough money not to have to bother."
</p>

<p>
"Lavinia, your cynical outlook surprises me.
But you see it isn't only things like that.  It's
Geoffrey.  Loving him would get so frightfully
in the way of my work.  I don't believe it's
possible to reconcile everything satisfactorily."
</p>

<p>
She shut her mouth obstinately and Lavinia
sighed.
</p>

<p>
"I really am sorry," she said.  "I think you
could be perfectly happy, you two; and of
course I'd love it from my own point of view,
so perhaps I'm prejudiced, but still I do think
it's possible."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't, Lavinia; don't let's talk about it any
more.  I must go now; I'm going to shut up the
studio for a bit; come and see me at home.
Mother would love you.  She thinks my friends
are apt to be a little erratic, and you'd be a
welcome change.  Goodbye and thanks; don't
come down."
</p>

<p>
As Helen walked home she was racked with
uncertainty.  Lavinia had shaken instead of
strengthening her decision.  Nothing of this
showed in her manner as she greeted Geoffrey
a little later.  He looked pale and ill, and when
she said, "Sit down and be a little comfortable,"
he only shook his head, looked at her dumbly,
and remained leaning against the mantelpiece.
</p>

<p>
"Geoffrey dear," she said.  "I've been thinking
and worrying about us, and I've come to the
conclusion that we simply mustn't see each other
any more.  I'm sorry; I'm sorry for myself, and
I'm sorry for you, but it's no good."
</p>

<p>
"You can't suddenly decide a thing like that;
it isn't fair," said Geoffrey, but he spoke
without conviction.
</p>

<p>
"I have decided," she answered.  "There's
no use going over the same old ground; don't
let's discuss it again.  I'm going home for a bit,
and I don't know whether I'll come back to this
studio or not, so there's no reason why we should
meet ever if we're reasonably careful to avoid
each other.  Goodbye, Geoffrey; I'd like you to
go now."
</p>

<p>
She spoke coldly, her plans seemed to
be cut and dried, and there was a finality
about her words that rang in Geoffrey's aching head.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said.  "I'll go now; goodbye."
</p>

<p>
Left alone, Helen began to pack a suitcase.
As she threw in coats, shoes, and frocks, tears
streamed steadily down her cheeks.  Mechanically,
she powdered her nose, locked the studio,
got out her car and drove to Lowndes Square
where she learned that her father and mother
were away for the week-end and her sister out
to dinner.
</p>

<p>
"I can easily get you something to eat, Miss
Helen, and your room will be ready in a
moment," said the parlourmaid pleasantly,
accustomed to Helen's sudden arrivals and equally
sudden departures.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want any dinner, thanks.  I'll have
a hot bath and go straight to bed, and I'd like a
bowl of bread and milk in bed, lots of sugar
and no crusts."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Miss Helen."
</p>

<p>
The maid disappeared with her case, as Helen
went into the library to find a book before
following her upstairs.  She slept heavily for twelve
hours and wakened to a mood of discouragement
and lethargy.  Life seemed meaningless.
The thought of painting did not attract her, she
had no particular engagements, there was
nothing to do.
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Guest, returning in the
evening, were pleased to find her in the library
sitting with her hands idle in her lap, but her
depression persisted and she answered her
Mother's questions with curt monosyllables.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm all right thanks.  No, nothing's
wrong.  Really, Mother, I'm all right.  I know
I look tired.  I've been working very hard, but
please just leave me alone."
</p>

<p>
In the weeks that followed she was forced to
repeat very often her plea to be left alone.  Her
family were used to the sight of Helen working,
but Helen idle and empty-handed was so unusual
that they made unceasing efforts to interest her
in their varying occupations which she as
unceasingly spurned.
</p>

<p>
A month went past during which she had not
lifted a brush and she was in her sitting-room
one afternoon wondering dismally if she would
ever again be caught by the desire to paint, when
Lavinia was announced.
</p>

<p>
Helen jumped to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Do come in, Lavinia.  I'm nearly mad with
mooning about doing nothing."
</p>

<p>
"But haven't you been painting?" Lavinia
asked a little maliciously.  "I thought you'd
given up Geoffrey so as to be able to paint."
</p>

<p>
Helen spread out her hands.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't done a thing," she said.  "Not a
single thing and what's more I don't know
whether I ever will or not.  Sit down and talk
to me, Lavinia."
</p>

<p>
"I can't," said Lavinia.  "I'm on my way to
Geoffrey now and I thought it just possible that
you would like to come with me.  You know he's
been ill?'
</p>

<p>
"I haven't heard a thing about him.  Tell me,
is he really ill?  What's wrong with him?  I'll
come with you at once."
</p>

<p>
"He's had influenza very badly.  He was
starting it that day you came to tea with me
when Mother was there; he went home that
night very seedy and he's really been pretty
bad.  He's much better now, but he's still in bed,
and Mother's going to be out this afternoon so
she rang me up to go and amuse him and I
thought perhaps you'd come too."
</p>

<p>
"He may not want to see me," said Helen.
</p>

<p>
"He does, I asked him," answered Lavinia coolly.
</p>

<p>
Helen's cheeks were glowing, her eyes shining.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go and change.  Wait here for me, I
won't be long," she said imperiously.
</p>

<p>
"No, I think I'll go on now and you can
follow when you're ready," suggested Lavinia.
</p>

<p>
Helen caught her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Please no," she said.  "Please wait.  I don't
want to go alone.  I'd rather go with you."
</p>

<p>
"You're shy," said Lavinia accusingly.
</p>

<p>
Helen was defiant and happy.
</p>

<p>
"And what if I am?" she said.  "I'm going to
ask Geoffrey to marry me, and I'd rather have a
chaperon there to make it more seemly.  Wait
here for me."
</p>

<p>
She rushed upstairs to dress, and came down
in the green frock and hat she had worn to
Lavinia's wedding.
</p>

<p>
"Look," she said.  "Sheer sentiment made me
put this on."
</p>

<p>
Lavinia looked at her standing in the doorway,
tall and upright, the rich green of her frock
bringing out all the colour in her hair and
skin.
</p>

<p>
"You're lovely," she said impulsively.
"Really lovely.  No wonder Geoffrey's quite
mad about you."
</p>

<p>
"Is he?" asked Helen.  "I do hope he is, I
want him to be.  You really think then I needn't
be nervous as to whether he'll accept me or
not."
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "Come on, Lavinia," she said.
"I can't wait.  I've had nothing for a month.
Neither my painting nor Geoffrey and evidently
I can't have one without the other, so even if
they fight I'll have to have both."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly her face sobered.
</p>

<p>
"It'll be a cat and dog life.  Everything I
meant it not to be, but damn it, I can't help it; I
can't do without him."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
If Mrs. Greene was distressed by her son's
engagement she concealed it perfectly after the
first moment, when, opening the door of
Geoffrey's bedroom, she was affronted by the sight
of a young woman almost a stranger to her,
sitting on the floor beside Geoffrey's bed, one
arm round his neck, a long leg sprawling, her
little green hat tossed on the hearthrug.
</p>

<p>
As Edith Greene stood in the doorway her
thoughts were bitter, her expression bleak; but
with undeniable gallantry she bowed to the
inevitable, twisted her face into a semblance of
happy surprise, and coming forward took
Helen's hand as she scrambled to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"My dears," she said, "this is very unexpected.
I didn't even know you knew Miss Guest,
Geoffrey, but I mustn't call you Miss Guest any
longer; it's Helen, isn't it, dear?"  She smiled
kindly, sat down on the edge of Geoffrey's bed
and said: "Now tell me all about it."
</p>

<p>
It was a magnificent recovery.  Geoffrey
looked guilty and miserable, but Helen was
filled with admiration.  She stood up tall and
unembarrassed, and leaning against the mantel-piece
explained the situation in her quiet voice.
</p>

<p>
"We really owe you an apology, Mrs. Greene.
Of course you must think it quite unseemly for
me to be here like this, when I've never been in
your house before, but everything has happened
very suddenly.  It's even been a surprise to us,
hasn't it, darling?"
</p>

<p>
She turned to Geoffrey, and Mrs. Greene's
start of annoyance at the last word was
unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
"Geoffrey asked me to marry him a long time
ago," she went on.  "I wouldn't for several
reasons, chiefly my work.  Then only to-day I
suddenly changed my mind and came to tell him
so; at least Lavinia brought me."
</p>

<p>
"You actually proposed to Helen a long time
ago, Geoffrey dear, and yet you've never
mentioned her name to me?"
</p>

<p>
The playful reproach in Mrs. Greene's voice
hid successfully the raging resentment in her
heart, but before Geoffrey could answer, Helen
broke in:
</p>

<p>
"That was entirely my fault.  I felt so uncertain
and wretched that the whole thing had to
be kept absolutely private."
</p>

<p>
"Even from Geoffrey's mother," asked Mrs. Greene
gently.
</p>

<p>
In the fading light Helen's young face looked
stern, but she, too, spoke gently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, even from you, I'm afraid.  It was so
vitally important to both of us that whichever
way it had turned, whether we decided to marry
or not to marry, we simply couldn't afford to let
in any outside influence."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Mrs. Greene slowly.  "I've never
really thought of myself as 'an outside
influence.'  My one desire has always been for my
children's happiness.  That's what comes first
with me and always will.  Geoffrey knows that;
you'll learn it too, dear."
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey had caught the undertone of acidity
that betrayed her real feelings, and he made an
effort to placate her.
</p>

<p>
"You really are amazing, Mother," he said.
"I know it must be a shock to you, but as Helen
says, it's a shock to us too."
</p>

<p>
She bent and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Geoffrey," she said, "I'm sure time
will prove it to be a pleasant shock, not the
reverse; I'm only too glad to have another little
daughter."
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey grinned and said tactlessly:
</p>

<p>
"Not really a little one, Mother; Helen's
quite a bit taller than you are."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene's armour cracked.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly," she said sharply.  "You
know quite well I wasn't referring to her size."
</p>

<p>
Putting a hand on his brow she regained her
poise.
</p>

<p>
"You're quite tired out," she said.  "<i>Such</i> a
hot head.  Now, Helen, I'm only going to give
you five minutes and then you must come downstairs
and let Geoffrey rest.  Come to the drawing-room,
will you, and have a little chat before
you go?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, I will," said Helen opening the
door for Mrs. Greene who turned her head to
smile tenderly at Geoffrey, gave Helen's
shoulder a little pat, sighed, and left the room.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
If Helen was secretly disgusted by all the elaborate
preparations for her wedding she disguised
her feelings with considerable skill, and took
part quite naturally, in endless discussions on
trousseaux, red carpets and white satin.  Both
her mother and Geoffrey's mother were
delighted at her unlooked-for docility, and
Mrs. Guest admitted quite frankly to Mrs. Greene
that Helen's engagement was having a very
settling effect on her; to which Mrs. Greene
replied firmly:
</p>

<p>
"Dear Helen.  We all expect so much of her
that I'm sure it makes her try to live up to our
ideals."
</p>

<p>
There was a slight uneasiness in the air on the
evening when Mrs. Greene asked brightly:
</p>

<p>
"And where are you two thinking of for your
honeymoon?"
</p>

<p>
Helen looked up from some patterns of shot
silk that she was considering.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the Hague I think," she said casually.
"There are some moderns there that I rather
want to see, and some quite good old stuff too,
I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Oh really.  Yes, that would be very nice I
suppose.  But of course it's a big town.  Don't you
think Geoffrey would be happier among beautiful
scenery?  The Italian lakes, perhaps, or
mountains if you want to be energetic."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, I'm sure."  Helen shrugged
her shoulders.  "Would you be happier with
scenery, Geoffrey?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I'd like the Hague," he said.  "For a
week or so, anyhow, and then we can move on."
</p>

<p>
"You know, dear," said Mrs. Greene reasonably,
"your interest in pictures is a very specialised
thing.  You mustn't expect Geoffrey to feel
quite as you do about them.  I don't think he
knows very much about art."
</p>

<p>
Helen's face was grim.
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't," she answered, "but he'll
learn."  And her mouth shut ominously.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Greene got up discreetly and murmuring
something about dressing for dinner, went upstairs.
</p>

<p>
"Darling," said Geoffrey.  "Mother thinks we
are now about to quarrel fiercely, but we aren't,
are we?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not.  I don't mind your not knowing
anything about painting so long as you don't
mind my concentrating on it a good deal."
</p>

<p>
"You know I don't.  Tell me, Helen, is all
this business driving you to frenzy?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not a bit.  I think it's frightfully
obscene, dressing up in white satin and being
handed over to you at a given moment, but I
can easily cope with it.  Isn't there something
about 'straining at a gnat and swallowing a
camel'?"
</p>

<p>
"And I'm the camel," said Geoffrey sullenly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you are," Helen answered calmly.  "And
you understand the position perfectly well.  You
know I am marrying you quite reluctantly for
the simple reason that I love you to distraction."
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey's face cleared.
</p>

<p>
"I am a fool," he said.  "It's quite all right,
Helen, and you're being marvellously good
about all this sickening detail."
</p>

<p>
Helen shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"It's your mother who's marvellous," she
said.  "She really is a masterpiece.  I've never seen
anything so well done as her pose.  She is so
affectionate and maternal that anyone would
think she was delighted with me.  In fact she's
almost coy, and yet she can't help disapproving
of almost everything I say or do."
</p>

<p>
"No, that isn't true; she's approved of you
quite a lot lately."
</p>

<p>
"Oh well, perhaps she has, but only because I
have given way about all sorts of conventional
details that go quite against the grain with me."
</p>

<p>
"Why have you, darling," Geoffrey asked
curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Well, she swallowed me so magnificently in
the first place that I felt I had to help to bolster
up her attitude.  It would be rather pathetic
really, if she knew we understood her so well.
She is a person who needs to be wrapped in the
illusion of success."
</p>

<p>
"It's kind of you to feel like that, I think,
though it would kill her to realise that you knew
so much about her that you were simply being
decent to her."
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow it's only a few more weeks now."
</p>

<p>
"Six weeks and three days, my dearest, and
after that we won't see much of them and
everything will go quite smoothly."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, it won't, Geoffrey," Helen's eyes
flickered dangerously, "it won't go the least
smoothly, it will be up and down like a very
rough crossing, but perfectly lovely all the
same."
</p>

<p>
"Dear heart, I'm sure of that; if only I can
keep you happy."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't have any doubts, Geoffrey.
I'm perfectly certain that fundamentally we're
right for each other."
</p>

<p>
The next few years proved the truth of
Helen's words.  Their honeymoon was exhausting,
awkward, and ecstatic but not, they decided,
more exhausting and awkward than other
people's honeymoons, and on the other hand,
certainly more ecstatic.
</p>

<p>
"It's odd how you stimulate me mentally,"
said Helen a little while after they got home to
the house in Cheyne Walk which Mrs. Rodney
so often referred as "very bright of course, but
rather too bizarre for my taste."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it is odd," contradicted Geoffrey,
"ever since we met we've acted as mutual
goads to each other."
</p>

<p>
"Yes I know," Helen answered impatiently,
"but it was different before we were married.
Really you know, I didn't do any decent work
between getting to know you and now.  You
remember that poster I was so pleased with?
Well it's quite awful.  I was on the wrong tack
altogether but now I do know what I'm about,
I entirely understand about the unity of angles."
</p>

<p>
"You don't suggest, do you, that I'm
responsible for enlarging your comprehension of
angles?" asked Geoffrey laughing.
</p>

<p>
"No of course not; you hadn't anything to do
with it.  I only mean that I'm very clear and free
in my mind just now, and that is partly because of
you.  You don't hinder me at all, you help me."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad," said Geoffrey, "keep free if you
can; there's no need to get in a mess with
things."
</p>

<p>
"I certainly won't."  Helen was emphatic.  "I
know your wretched aunt and all sorts of people
expect to be asked here just because I'm newly
married and have a new house, but I simply
won't do it.  And I'm not going to pay any calls
either."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want you to do things like that.
Lavinia does it plenty enough for one family,
and Hugh's wife, when he has one, is sure to be
a model of propriety.  But I want you to go on
being Helen Guest even if you are Mrs. Geoffrey
Greene.  Don't fuss about my family."
</p>

<p>
"You do understand remarkably well, Geoffrey.
I'd have to go my own way in any case, but
I'm terribly glad you're with me in my policy
of being ruthless."
</p>

<p>
By means of keeping to this policy of ruthlessness
life went happily for the young Geoffrey
Greenes.  There was a period of stress and strain
in the second year of their marriage when Helen
decided that a frankly futurist style was the only
one in which she could express herself sincerely.
Her first attempts were almost ludicrously
unsuccessful, and Geoffrey was so rash as to burst
out laughing as he looked at a canvas in which
a large purple cylinder placed on a still larger
purple cylinder, and surmounted by a smaller
cylinder of shrimp pink faintly spotted, was
entitled simply "Country woman."
</p>

<p>
Helen looked at him coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you being a little crude, Geoffrey?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mislay your sense of humour, I do
implore you," he urged still laughing, "I expect
this is a very important picture, but to the
uninitiated eye it's very funny."
</p>

<p>
"That's just the trouble, Geoffrey.  You are
uninitiated&mdash;almost painfully so.  I've been
feeling out of sympathy with you for some time.
I'm prepared to agree with you that this is bad
work, though the idea is perfectly sound,
but I think it's bad because of you.  I'm
being clogged by marriage, it's hampering me
appallingly."
</p>

<p>
"You're working yourself up, Helen," said
Geoffrey curtly, "I refuse to be made responsible
because you do bad work."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry."  Helen's voice was hard.  "But
the fact remains that indirectly you are responsible.
Marriage is not conducive to good work,
and I've decided to cut it out for a time anyhow.
I'm quite contented to go on living in this house
if you will arrange to sleep in your dressing-room
and leave me entirely unmolested."
</p>

<p>
"You're unpardonable.  I don't know how you
dare use a word like that about me."
</p>

<p>
"I'll apologise for it if you like, it wasn't
the word I meant.  But I wish to be quite free
and not be expected to sleep with you again."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," Geoffrey agreed stiffly, "that is
for you to decide."
</p>

<p>
Their reconciliation a few weeks later was
disproportionately trivial.  Helen's futurist fever
had burned itself out, and she was temporarily
high and dry without any interest in art.
</p>

<p>
Geoffrey came into her studio one night to find
her looking ruefully at "Country Woman."  She
went up to him and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
"I've been a bloody fool, Geoffrey darling,
I'm terribly sorry.  You were quite right; it really
is a ghastly picture.  Let's burn it now."
</p>

<p>
"You've been awful," said Geoffrey, but his
voice was kind.
</p>

<p>
"I know I have, but I swear I never will
again.  Come on, let's burn it."
</p>

<p>
Childishly they cut the canvas into strips,
crumpled it up, and crammed it into the fire,
and as Helen quoted happily "if thine eye offend
thee pluck it out" the last traces of Geoffrey's
resentment melted and he held her to him with a
passion intensified by the past weeks of restraint.
No quarrel marked the end of her next phase,
which was a return to the impressionist style of
her pre-marriage period.
</p>

<p>
"It's no good," she proclaimed dismally, "I'm
doing rotten work."
</p>

<p>
"I hope you're not going to blame me and
marriage this time?" asked Geoffrey, with a faint
accent of anxiety under his light manner.
</p>

<p>
Helen smiled at him frankly.
</p>

<p>
"Good God, no," she said, "I know better now.
I've got you perfectly in place, Geoffrey.  You're
the one absolutely necessary thing in my life that
I shall probably always stick to.  All this stuff,"
she waved an airy hand round the studio, "is
variable, if you know what I mean.  I can't do
without it, but it changes.  Heaven knows it's bad
enough now, but sometime I'm going to do
something good."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean you've arranged your life in
compartments, with me in one and your painting
in another, and so on?"
</p>

<p>
"No I don't mean that.  I did try it at one
time, but it was hopeless.  When I got mad with
my painting, my rage overlapped out of
the painting compartment into yours.  But
now it's different; you're separate from
everything and yet at the bottom of everything.
I can't explain quite what I mean, but it works
all right."
</p>

<p>
"Darling, do you mean that in your mind I'm
independent of the other things you care about,
but in a way they are dependent on me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think that's it.  Anyhow I'm happy."
</p>

<p>
"So am I, Helen, really frightfully happy."
</p>

<p>
"And what's more Geoffrey I think I'll probably
be able to fit a child in too."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that you want one?  Don't do
it for me; I'm perfectly satisfied with things as
they are."
</p>

<p>
Helen came over and sat beside Geoffrey on
the sofa, leaning back in her corner and gazing
at the fire.  She was silent for a few minutes, and
Geoffrey looking at the firelight playing over
her bright hair wondered vaguely what she was
thinking.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I specially want one," she said
at last, "at least if I do it's for pure idiotic
sentimental reasons.  But on the other hand I'm not
sure that I won't paint better after I've had one;
you can't be certain really that every possible
experience isn't all to the good."
</p>

<p>
"I think probably it is," agreed Geoffrey, "Of
course I like you to want one for idiotic
sentimental reasons; it makes me feel surer of you;
but quite apart from that there is your painting.
I know you're depressed about it just now and it
might start you off working again if you had a
child."
</p>

<p>
"Geoffrey, you're rather sweet to me," said
Helen impulsively, "I think it's touching of you
to understand that having a baby might make
me paint better.  It's a topsy turvy idea I know,
but I can't help seeing it in that way."
</p>

<p>
"Sometime I suppose you'll get used to my
being able to see things from your point of
view," said Geoffrey contentedly.
</p>

<p>
Helen lifted his hand and kissed it.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I'll get too used to you, darling,"
she said, "I really love you very much."
</p>

<p>
The telephone rang in the hall before Geoffrey
could answer her.
</p>

<p>
"Damn," she said getting up lazily, "I'm sure
that's your mother, she always rings up at this
time of night because she feels sure of getting
us both at once."
</p>

<p>
She shut the door, and the one-sided conversation
was too subdued to interrupt Geoffrey's
thoughts.  They were entirely pleasant.  His
marriage satisfied him mentally and delighted him
physically.  His occasional fierce quarrels with
Helen seemed mere surface disturbances; they
did not affect in the slightest their mutual love,
though they undoubtedly eradicated in Geoffrey
any tendency towards complacency.
</p>

<p>
He lay stretched out luxuriously on the sofa,
and looking back, found that the storms and
agonies that had preceded his engagement were
dim in his memory.  They belonged to a stage
that was definitely over.
</p>

<p>
Helen came back into the studio, her eyes dancing.
</p>

<p>
"You needn't tell me," said Geoffrey, "I can
see by your face that you've been talking to
mother.  What's she done now?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Geoffrey, it really is gorgeous.  She's got
the most perfect idea.  You know Hugh and
Jessica are coming back on Tuesday?  Well, she
proposes to have a party the Friday after for
your grannie and great-aunt Sarah and aunt
Dora and Jessica and me.  All six of us do you
see?  And such husbands as there are, naturally."
</p>

<p>
"It sounds monstrous.  Must we go?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course we must, and it isn't monstrous at
all.  I do wish you appreciated your mother;
she'll be at her best stage-managing a thing like
that.  It will be a perfect puppet show; she'll
pull the wires and we'll dance."
</p>

<p>
"Darling, why do you dance?  Is it pure malice?"
</p>

<p>
"No it isn't.  A little bit, yes.  I do love to see
how far she'll go.  When we talk about art, for
instance, I give her cues to see if she'll take
them, and she does every time.  Out she trots the
same old clich√©s; it never fails.  But mostly it's
because I really admire her; she's so consistently
unreal, she isn't a person at all, she's a peg hung
with old worn out conventions and traditions,
and yet she comports herself as if she were more
real than any one else in the world."
</p>

<p>
"I'm her son; am I unreal too?" Geoffrey
asked soberly.
</p>

<p>
"My darling, you're not."
</p>

<p>
Helen stood away from him, looking down at
him serenely, her hands clasped loosely in front
of her, her manner serious.
</p>

<p>
"You're real to me, just as I expect she and
your father are real to each other.  I'm an
individualist.  I suppose I'm what people would
call temperamental, but I'm not entirely
imbecile.  I appreciate quite clearly that I have an
enormous lot in common with your mother.  As
regards the ordinary practical things of life we
do just the same as your parents did.  I don't
mean only things like marrying, and having
children, and dying.  But we're the product of
the same education and very much the same kind
of home.  We have the same income, and move
in much the same set.  The differences between
us are mainly superficial and illusionary.  Your
mother, for instance, has an illusion about
motherhood and all that, and I have one about
art, but we're both in the tradition of suitable
wives for the male Greene."
</p>

<p>
"It <i>is</i> odd to hear you talk like that.  I should
have thought that you would have passionately
repudiated any sort of kinship with mother.  And
surely the differences between people are very
sharp?  Whatever you may say, you're very
distinct from other people."
</p>

<p>
"Not now," said Helen positively.  "When I
was very young, yes, and when I'm old then I'll
be Helen Guest again, but now I'm just beginning
on the middle years and your mother's just
getting to the end of them, but we've all the
experiences of life in common, even if we do
approach them from a totally different stand-point."
</p>

<p>
"I see what you mean.  But you won't change
will you, Helen?  You won't be less yourself if
you have a baby?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think I'll change; I don't think I'll be
less myself but anyhow you'll have to risk that."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want you any different," said Geoffrey
very quietly.
</p>

<p>
Helen threw back her head and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know," she said, "I may become
too awful, or I may improve enormously; the
only single certain thing is that within the next
year or two I'm going to do some good work."
</p>

<p>
"You're like mother in one way anyhow: in
your brutally uncompromising optimism."
</p>

<p>
"And in another way too," Helen countered
swiftly, "that I do most genuinely love one of
the Mr. Greenes."

MRS. HUGH BECKETT GREENE

<p class="t3">
I
</p>

<p>
Jessica Deane wakened very early on her
wedding morning and got up at once to look at
the weather.  The sun was slowly climbing up
a clear sky, and there was a cold frostiness in
the air that matched her mood.  She looked out
westwards over the roofs in the direction of the
Greenes' house, and wondered whether Hugh
were asleep or awake, and if awake whether he
were feeling like her, keenly strung up, and
exquisitely expectant, or only nervous and
worried at the thought of dressing up to face a
crowded church and a still more crowded reception.
</p>

<p>
She crossed over to the long mirror and
studied her face at close range.  It would be
awful to have a spot on my chin, she thought
anxiously, even the smallest beginning of a spot
would spoil my nerve, or a bloodshot eye, or
hiccups at the last minute.  What appalling things
might happen to destroy me to-day.
</p>

<p>
The mirror faithfully reflected back her own
expression of dismay as she thought of all the
depressing contingencies that might arise, and
as she looked at it her face broke into a smile.
Satisfied that even a close scrutiny showed no
blemish, she stepped back a pace and looked at
herself in detail.
</p>

<p>
My hair grows well, she thought dispassionately,
I'm glad it's so fair and goes back like
that off my forehead, but I think my eyes are
too wide apart, and really my chin is almost
negligible, it fades away to nothing.  In fact
twenty years ago I would have been plain, it's
pure luck that my kind of face happens to be in
the mode at present.  It's lucky too that Hugh
is so dark; we ought to look nice together.
</p>

<p>
Her mind plunged forward a few hours; and
she laid a nervous hand on her heart beating so
lightly and quickly under the lace of her
nightgown as she thought of herself and Hugh
standing at the flowered altar with rows and
rows of massed curious faces behind.
</p>

<p>
Seized by a sudden desire to reassure herself
by a sight of her wedding frock, Jessica went
quietly into the spare bedroom where frock,
train and veil were spread out on the bed.  She
lifted the white sheet that protected them and
looked at the shining gold tissue of frock and
train, and the old ivory veil lent by her
godmother; then suddenly picking them up she
bore them off to her room.
</p>

<p>
Of course it's desperately unlucky to try on
your frock when it's quite finished&mdash;she argued
with herself&mdash;but Hugh and I don't need luck
and I'm not superstitious, and I would terribly
like to make sure that it's as nice as I think it is.
Taking off her nightgown she put on a new
vest of yellow silk to match the frock, gold
stockings and the pointed gold shoes that were
to carry her up the aisle as Jessica Deane and
down again as Jessica Greene.
</p>

<p>
Just as she slipped the frock over her head,
and struggled into the long close-fitting sleeves,
a voice from the doorway said, "Darling, are you
mad?  I heard you bumping about and thought
I'd better come and see if you were having a
nerve storm or something."
</p>

<p>
"Do come and help me, Drusilla, it's a frightfully
difficult dress to get into.  Pull it down all
round will you; I just suddenly felt I had to
put it on."
</p>

<p>
Jessica's face, faintly flushed from her
struggle, appeared out of a swirl of gold, and
she blushed deeper with embarrassment as she
confronted her sister's cool, critical gaze.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I am silly," she said defiantly, "In
fact I know it's silly to be trying on my wedding
dress at this unearthly hour in the morning, but
brides are always allowed to behave idiotically
on their wedding day."
</p>

<p>
"Not this sort of idiocy, though," said Drusilla
calmly, "tears and hysterics, and changing
your mind at the last minute if you like, but not
just pure vanity.  I think that's all right now."
</p>

<p>
Drusilla, who was kneeling to pull down the
long skirt, leaned back on her heels and fingered
its stiff folds.
</p>

<p>
"It's lovely," she said, "I'm glad you had it
long enough to touch your toes, and I'm glad
it's a picture frock too.  I know they're overdone,
but they do suit us, we're just the type."
</p>

<p>
She got up and stood in her green dressing-gown
beside Jessica in her formal gold tissue.
</p>

<p>
"We're absurdly alike," said Jessica looking
in the mirror at their two faces, with the same
broad foreheads, grey eyes, pointed chins, and
backward springing yellow hair, "If anything,
I think you're prettier than me."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Drusilla, complacently.
"You vary more of course, but at your best I
think you're a little better than me.  Anyhow
we'll both be all right to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I do hope so.  You know I really feel looks
matter frightfully.  I feel so entirely right
about Hugh, and I would like to look as
dazzling as I feel, but it simply isn't possible."
</p>

<p>
"Are you really as much in love as all that?"
Drusilla asked curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am," answered Jessica, her face intent
and serious, "I'm madly in love and so is Hugh,
and we think we can pull off a really lovely
marriage."
</p>

<p>
Drusilla sighed.
</p>

<p>
"You're a funny whole-hearted little creature,"
she said.  "It's queer that I'm two years
older than you, and I've never been the least
bit in love."
</p>

<p>
"Do just get me out of this," said Jessica, but
as she began to pull the long sleeves over her
hands a sudden shaft of sunlight struck across
the room, and lit up her yellow hair and her
gold gown.
</p>

<p>
"Oh look, Drusilla, how beautifully lucky;
what a proper omen."
</p>

<p>
She twisted herself so that the sun caught her
shining train.
</p>

<p>
"I think it is rather lucky," Drusilla assented,
"here, let me take it off before you tear it on
anything."
</p>

<p>
"Drusilla, let's go and look at the presents
again," said Jessica, as she carefully hung the
discarded frock over a chair, and put on her
dressing-gown.
</p>

<p>
"You really are crazy, I think; you've seen
them a thousand times."
</p>

<p>
"Yes I know, but never in the early morning,
and they'll look quite different.  Besides, two
came last night and I want to put them with the
others in the billiard-room."
</p>

<p>
"Come on then if you must, but for goodness
sake be quiet.  Mother will be unhinged if she
thinks you're awake so early.  You're supposed
to be having breakfast in bed at ten, aren't
you?"
</p>

<p>
Very quietly Jessica and Drusilla crept downstairs,
turning to smile at each other when a step
creaked, with an expression of childish guilt for
the clandestine little expedition.  As they reached
the bottom of the stairs the banisters cracked
loudly.  Jessica seized Drusilla's hand, giggled
and ran across the hall into the billiard-room,
where the presents in a glittering mass covered
the large table and smaller tables placed round
the walls.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, I believe I'm rather excited,"
said Jessica, giggling again, "I never meant to
be and I don't expect I will be after breakfast,
but at present I feel just silly."
</p>

<p>
"You're light-headed I think.  But it will
wear off later on.  And it's better than being
gloomy.  Do you remember how awful Marjorie
was?  I shall never forget how you and I
spent the whole morning propping her up, and
talking endlessly about all sorts of imbecile
things, because as soon as we stopped she cried."
</p>

<p>
Drusilla and Jessica laughed out loud at the
thought of their eldest sister's wedding four
years ago when the bride had gone to the altar
as if to a sacrifice, with tears and forebodings.
</p>

<p>
"How ugly our bridesmaids' frocks were
too," said Jessica reminiscently.  "You know it's
funny how unlike us Marjorie is; you and I
always laugh at the same things, and take the
same things seriously, and we look alike too, but
Marjorie is hopelessly different; so very
homespun somehow."
</p>

<p>
"You're not quite homespun enough you
know; I often wonder how you'll stay the
course."
</p>

<p>
"Oh Drusilla, don't be so sinister I implore
you, or I'll go all weepy like Marjorie.  Besides
I'm not half so trivial and erratic as you think.
I'm pretty solid really; it's only when I think
of Hugh I feel like a gas-filled balloon."
</p>

<p>
"This is a ghastly thing," said Drusilla
inconsequently lifting up a heavy silver cake stand
and turning it about to see if there was any angle
at which it could be considered anything but
ugly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, isn't it atrocious.  But at least it's silver.
Just think of the Blakes giving us that awful
electro-plate tea-pot when they are as rich as
Cr≈ìsus too.  I think it's pretty stingy of them,
and it's a hideous shape too."
</p>

<p>
"Well they don't like you, you know," said
Drusilla calmly, "They think you're aggressively
modern and probably rather fast, so really it
was very good of them to give you anything."
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that at all.  They only did give it
me because they like Mother and Daddy; it was
nothing to do with me at all.  Drusilla, isn't it
funny how people show off with wedding
presents?  That huge china jar from the Carters
I mean, obviously chosen for its bulk, and I'd
simply have loved it if it had been so small you
could hardly see it; about as big as a thimble
perhaps."
</p>

<p>
Jessica wandered down the long table, touching
the silver objects carelessly, but gently
stroking the china.  Drusilla, who was draping a
Spanish shawl more elegantly over a screen,
looked up and laughed at her.
</p>

<p>
"You really are impossible," she said, "How
could you want a jar the size of a thimble.  That
one will be useful for umbrellas too."
</p>

<p>
Jessica clasped her hands passionately.
</p>

<p>
"I know," she said, "I know one must have
umbrellas, and things must be big, but I'd like
to be a dwarf and live in an exquisite little
Japanese garden.  Small things are so very rare."
</p>

<p>
"Not really," Drusilla disagreed, "they're
often very mean and cunning."
</p>

<p>
"How vile you are to disagree with me to-day,"
said Jessica happily.  "Oh, Drusilla, just
look at this!  Four sets of coffee cups all cheek
by jowl!  How shockingly tactless!  All the
people who gave me coffee cups will have their
feelings terribly hurt, and wish they had given
me mustard pots instead.  I must rearrange them.
One here and one there wouldn't be so noticeable."
</p>

<p>
Drusilla picked up a small jeweller's box
and looked at the long string of jade curled
round on the white velvet lining.
</p>

<p>
"A gorgeous present," she commented, "Jade
is lovely stuff, and it suits you too.  Really I
think it very decent of old Mrs. Hugh to give
you a personal present like that."
</p>

<p>
"I like her; she's rather a pet.  And I like
Hugh's Grannie too, she's frightfully nice.  I do
hope she likes me because I know she loves
Hugh and I'd hate to come between them.  It's
only Hugh's mother I'm frightened of, though
I like her too.  You know, sooner or later I'm
bound to shock her.  She thinks I'm a child,
and Hugh and I are a pretty little couple and
so on, and if I said something was bloody&mdash;and
I might easily, even with her there&mdash;she'd have
a fit."
</p>

<p>
"You probably will give her a shock some
time.  She's absolutely wrapped in illusions as
far as I can see, especially about her children."
</p>

<p>
"I know she is," Jessica sighed, "you know,
Drusilla, I'd like to have a good many children,
especially boys I think, but I'd rather drown
them at birth than live on them as Mrs. Greene
does."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
Jessica relapsed into vagueness.  "I don't
know," she said, "only she seems so mixed up
with them somehow, and Hugh is so utterly
exquisite when you think of him as an isolated
identity."
</p>

<p>
"He is rather, but you'd better not think of
him as an isolated identity; he isn't ever likely
to be, he's part of a very compact family and
you'll be part of it too."
</p>

<p>
"I know, I'll have to get used to it, and it
doesn't really matter.  I'd swallow a clan of
Jews from Whitechapel to get Hugh, if I had
to."
</p>

<p>
The hall clock struck seven.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you finished fussing over the
presents yet," said Drusilla.  "You must have
spaced out the coffee cups by now, and I do
think you ought to go back to bed again for a bit."
</p>

<p>
"All right, I'll come now.  The maids will be
up in a minute, and we'd better creep back now
before they hear us."
</p>

<p>
They stole quietly upstairs and Jessica got
into bed again.
</p>

<p>
"Stay a minute, Drusilla, sit on the bed and
let's talk," she said, and immediately fell silent.
Drusilla waited.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what about it?" she asked at last.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Jessica seriously, "there
really is nothing to say at all.  Here I am sort of
suspended in mid-air between never-been-married,
and never-again-be-unmarried, and
I'm not sure that I'll ever feel anything much
lovelier than this, just waiting till I see Hugh
this afternoon at 2.30 exactly."
</p>

<p>
"Darling, you're all agog.  It is nice.  I wish I
could fall in love like that."
</p>

<p>
"I used to think you were a little fond of
Stephen Wilcox, weren't you?" asked Jessica
curiously, "but don't say so if you'd rather not;
it's an indelicate question."  She blushed
furiously, but Drusilla answered quite unmoved.
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, I was rather, but one night at a
dance he kissed me a lot, and got very worked
up, and it struck me as just funny and rather
clumsy.  I didn't have the faintest thrill, so I
knew it wouldn't do."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not at all like that," Jessica spoke with
solemn emphasis.  "I get the most extraordinary
thrills when Hugh kisses me.  He musses all my
clothes and untidies my hair, and my face gets
all blotched and red, and I simply love it.  In
fact I think I'm very passionate, and it's a good
thing if I am, because Hugh says he is."
</p>

<p>
"God knows how he manages it with those
parents, but I should think he may be all the
same, he's so good-looking."  Drusilla yawned.
"I think I'd better go now," she said, "you look
sleepy, and I am too, and it's still nearly two
hours till breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"Oh don't go yet, stay one more minute,"
Jessica begged, "I do like talking to you.
Drusilla; I feel most awfully glad I'm a
virgin.  Isn't it lucky?  It would be terrible to
have a past, don't you think, so disappointing
somehow."
</p>

<p>
"You're being incredibly Victorian; all worked
up and excited and old-fashioned, and besides,
my girl, you have a past.  What about that awful
boy Richardson when you were seventeen?"
</p>

<p>
Jessica's face and neck crimsoned slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't tease me about that," she said, "I can
hardly bear to think of it, it was so undignified
and vulgar, and when Mother found us kissing
in the garage it was absolute Hell.  I can hardly
believe it's two years since it happened; it feels
like yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry I teased you then," said Drusilla
smiling, "honestly I thought you'd have forgotten
all about it by now.  Anyhow it's not
important in the least I promise you."  She stood
up and looking down at Jessica added "Really
you're not to fuss about it now; Hugh is charming,
and you'll be married to him in a minute
and live happily ever after."
</p>

<p>
"I know I will," said Jessica lazily, and as
Drusilla shut the door she turned over and
smoothed her pillow happily conscious that the
next morning Hugh's dark head would be lying
on it, beside her.  Darling Hugh, she thought
drowsily, and fell asleep regardless of the
sunlight on her face.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
The sound of her mother's voice woke her
for the second time.
</p>

<p>
"My dear child, do you know it's half past
ten?  I really thought I'd better wake you to
have some breakfast."
</p>

<p>
She was followed by a maid carrying a tray,
and as Jessica pushed back her hair, rubbed her
eyes and sat up, Mrs. Deane took the tray, put
it on a table and sat down on the bed.  She kissed
Jessica and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You know I feel quite sentimental," she
said, "and a little excited too.  After all, here you
are, my youngest daughter on her wedding day,
a most thrilling event for any mother."
</p>

<p>
"You're every bit as bad as I am, Mother.
Do you know when I was awake before, I felt
so silly that I couldn't stop giggling!  Do you
know the feeling?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I do, but oh, my dear"&mdash;Mrs. Deane
caught her breath&mdash;"I'm going to miss
you terribly.  The house will be as quiet as a
tomb without you.  When I sit in the front pew
this afternoon watching you and your father
come up the aisle, I shall shed tears into my
bouquet."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't darling, really you mustn't.  I'll
be completely mortified if you do.  I can't have
you weeping at my wedding.  I know Marjorie
will, and that'll be bad enough, heaven
knows."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you must have your breakfast now,
anyhow," said Mrs. Deane getting up decisively
to pour out the coffee, "but I warn you that
whatever you say, I shall shed a tear or
two.  What I shall do when Drusilla marries
I can't think.  Thank goodness I've still got
her."
</p>

<p>
"By that time you'll have shoals of grandchildren
to console you," Jessica suggested comfortably.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Jessica&mdash;&mdash;" began Mrs. Deane,
but broke off suddenly and continued, "Oh well
I suppose you young things know your own
business best, but I could never even have
thought a thing like that on my wedding morning."
</p>

<p>
"No darling, I don't suppose you could, but
then your generation was so stuffy, wasn't it?"
said Jessica gently.
</p>

<p>
"Some of us were very happy anyhow," retorted
Mrs. Deane, kissing Jessica again, "I
couldn't want anything better for you than to be
as happy with Hugh as I've been with your
father.  But really, my dear, it's very naughty of
you to keep me here gossiping.  I have a
hundred and one things to see to, in fact I must
go this minute and see if the bouquets have
arrived yet.  Eat a proper breakfast and don't
hurry."
</p>

<p>
As Mrs. Deane opened the door Drusilla
appeared on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Mother," she said with an accent of the
deepest reproach, "you're no good at all.  You
ought to have been having a serious talk with
Jessica.  I've been eavesdropping for hours,
hoping you would begin to instruct her in the
facts of life, and all I heard was her telling you
you were stuffy!"
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Deane blushed she looked like
both her daughters, and now she twisted her
fingers in a gesture that Jessica, too, was
betrayed into in moments of embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
"Really you are terrible," she said distractedly,
"both of you.  I don't know which of you
is the most indelicate.  I shall go and take refuge
with the caterers and the furniture men.  They
have much nicer minds than either of my
daughters.  Good-bye, darlings."
</p>

<p>
She hurried out and Drusilla took her place
on Jessica's bed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm holding a series of audiences this morning,"
said Jessica, "Obviously it's the proper
thing for all the family to tip-toe in and
peep at me ghoulishly to make sure I
haven't faded away in the night.  Isn't mother
a duck?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she's rather sweet," answered Drusilla,
"and frightfully competent too.  You know there
is a vast amount of arranging to be done for a
show like this, and you and I haven't done a
hand's-turn to help, have we?"
</p>

<p>
Jessica's white forehead wrinkled into a frown.
</p>

<p>
"It's rather worrying," she began.  "Of course
I shan't have to bother about anything on my
honeymoon.  Hugh is marvellous about trains
and arrangements and he can do it all, but I
suppose in a month when we come home I'll
have to settle down and be a proper person, and
everyone will criticise me."
</p>

<p>
"Not any more than they do now surely?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, far more.  A few of the Greene relations
may swallow me, but most of them will
think everything I do is wrong, and they'll be
sorry for Hugh, and you know quite well,
Drusilla, that I shall never be able to scold the
servants."
</p>

<p>
"I think that probably comes with practice,"
Drusilla reassured her, "and, anyhow, you aren't
going to be living so far away that we can't keep
an eye on you."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  That does help of course.  But
Drusilla I do feel I must go on letting Hugh
be a Greene; I mustn't try to absorb him into
our family.  I really have a scruple about it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't think you need have.  There
isn't the faintest chance of Hugh being disassociated
from his family.  But anyhow you're full
of contradictions; only this morning you said
you thought of him as an isolated fragment or
something."
</p>

<p>
"Really Drusilla, you're very dense
sometimes," said Jessica a little piqued, but Drusilla
only laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You can't possibly understand," began
Jessica, but at the sound of a car drawing up at
the front door below with a good deal of
unnecessary hooting, she stopped and sat bolt
upright, a scarlet patch of excitement on either
cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Drusilla, that's Hugh!" she said, and jumping
out of bed she darted over to the window,
pushed it up and hung out, waving wildly.
</p>

<p>
Drusilla leaned over her shoulder, and saw
Hugh standing on the steps below carrying two
huge parcels and smiling up at Jessica.
</p>

<p>
"Darling, come up and see me," called Jessica,
"it's most unseemly of you to be here on our
wedding day, but since you are here you must
come up.  What have you come for anyhow?"
</p>

<p>
"Two important presents from two important
people," said Hugh gaily, "Mother wants them
shown in most conspicuous places, and incidentally
she thought she'd better give me a job to
keep my nerves steady."
</p>

<p>
"Oh are you nervous, Hugh?  Do come up at
once, dearest.  Why does nobody let you in?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose you've rung, have you?"
Drusilla called down.
</p>

<p>
"Heavens, I forgot," said Hugh laughing, "I
was just going to when Jessica appeared for the
balcony scene."
</p>

<p>
He laid down one parcel, and rang the bell,
still looking up.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't you throw me a flower or something
romantic?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Jessica tore a small bow of gold ribbon off the
shoulder of her nightgown, kissed it and flung it
down to him.
</p>

<p>
"There you are," she called, watching it
flutter slowly and uncertainly down to the street,
"my God, it's going down into the area; it'll be
wasted on cook.  No it isn't; it's all right."
</p>

<p>
As her shrill excited tones followed the
flight of the light scrap of ribbon, a shocked and
inquisitive face appeared at the window opposite,
and at the same moment she heard her
mother's voice behind her.
</p>

<p>
"Jessica, come in at once.  This is really too
much; you must not lean out of the window in
your nightgown; Drusilla, you shouldn't have
allowed her."
</p>

<p>
Jessica waved airily to Hugh, blew a kiss to
the face in the opposite house, drew in her head
and shut the window.
</p>

<p>
"It's Hugh, Mother," she said as if that
explained the whole situation, "he's down below
with two important parcels from two important
people."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that makes it worse," said Mrs. Deane
severely, "you were hanging half out of the
window and all the top of your nightgown is
transparent lace.  Really I feel quite cross with
you both."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be cross, darling," implored Jessica.
"My trousseau nighties are far more indecent
than this, and look, I'll put on a dressing-gown
before he comes up."
</p>

<p>
"He is certainly not coming up, Jessica.  It
would be most unsuitable."
</p>

<p>
Jessica flung her arms round her mother's
neck and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, darling," she said, "We won't outrage
you any more; he shan't come up; I'll go
down to him instead."
</p>

<p>
Laughing, she snatched up her dressing-gown
and ran out of the room and downstairs, her
bare feet flashing white over the green carpet.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Deane laughed reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm perfectly helpless with Hugh and Jessica,"
she said, "It's no use hoping for any sense
from either of them.  Jessica is like a child;
she's quite fey with excitement."
</p>

<p>
"It's really all right Mother," Drusilla
soothed her.  "She's frightfully happy and they
do suit each other well.  I honestly think Hugh
understands her perfectly."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I feel that too," said Mrs. Deane,
going out on to the landing, "It's very
satisfactory because Jessica <i>is</i> so temperamental."
</p>

<p>
She leaned over the banisters and then turned
smiling to Drusilla.
</p>

<p>
"Just look at them on the landing; they
wouldn't mind if the servants and the caterers
and all the furniture men were drawn up in
rows to look at them."
</p>

<p>
Quickly sensitive to the watching eyes above,
Hugh looked up.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Mrs. Deane," he said apologetically,
"I know I oughtn't to be here, but Mother sent
me round with a couple of presents, and now I
am here I must talk to Jessica for a minute."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course, my dear," agreed Mrs. Deane,
entirely forgetting her conventional
qualms, "go into my sitting-room; it's the only
room in the house that isn't upside-down.  But
really you can only have ten minutes and then
Jessica must come upstairs."
</p>

<p>
She turned to Drusilla.
</p>

<p>
"Do go down and talk to your father, dearest.
The servants have chased him from room to
room, and now he's pacing round the billiard
table in a terrible state of nerves.  He ought to
have gone to his office; it would have been much
more sensible, but he had a feeling that Jessica
might want him."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Mother; what are you going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm just going to see that all her things are
properly packed.  But you know, Drusilla, I do
not think she should have said her nightgowns
were indecent."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Mother," said Drusilla decisively,
going downstairs, "if you take seriously any
one thing Jessica may say to-day you will
forfeit all my respect and admiration."
</p>

<p>
"I hope she'll be serious in church at least,"
retorted Mrs. Deane, and went into the spare
bedroom to look a little mournfully at Jessica's
strapped trunks.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
III
</p>

<p>
In the sitting-room Hugh and Jessica sat down
on the rug in front of the fire.  Hugh suddenly
noticed her bare toes.
</p>

<p>
"My sweet," he said, "did you come running
downstairs to me, all in your bare toes?"
</p>

<p>
Jessica leaned restfully against him as she
answered: "Of course I did.  I didn't dare wait
in case Mother would stop me, and anyhow, I
forgot about slippers."
</p>

<p>
She took his hand and gently flexed the
fingers one by one.
</p>

<p>
"I've been mad with excitement all morning,"
she said.  "And now you are with me I feel
quite comfortable and easy and peaceful."
</p>

<p>
"We ought always to be together," said
Hugh emphatically.  "I hate to think I'll have
to leave you alone every day when I go to the
office."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but that's years away.  A whole month
at least before we need think about it.  All the
same I would rather like to be a typist, or
perhaps something a little grander, in your office.
Couldn't it be arranged?"
</p>

<p>
"It could not, darling; not possibly; but
anyhow it will be good coming home to you in the
evenings."
</p>

<p>
"It's a pity there are so many magazine
stories," said Jessica hazily, gazing into the
fire.  "You know the sort of stuff: bright eyes at
the window, or the little woman at the garden
gate.  Now I shall be forced to stay on the sofa
in my elegant yellow drawing-room and when
you come in I shall just look up from my book
in a casual way, and say, 'Hello Hugh!'"
</p>

<p>
"If you do wait like that I'll know you don't
love me any more.  You never wait for people
you love, or even people you like; you always
rush to meet them."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I'm going to be quite different now.
When I'm a young matron&mdash;isn't it a ghastly
expression?&mdash;I shall behave like a young
matron and put away childish things and stop
looking through a glass darkly."
</p>

<p>
"All at once, sweetheart?  Jessica, I do love
you so."
</p>

<p>
Hugh caught her to him and kissed her, but
she gently warded him off.
</p>

<p>
"I love you too, Hugh; I adore you, but you
mustn't spoil my face.  It isn't vanity, but I do
want to look lovely for you to-day."
</p>

<p>
"My dearest, you will.  You couldn't look
lovelier than you do now all rumpled and
crumpled, but still I've often looked forward to
your coming up the aisle to me in the gold frock
and train that I've never seen, with a veil all
over your darling face."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not wearing it over my face; it didn't go
with my kind of naked forehead.  It just falls
back from a thing they call a fillet.  Have you
really imagined that, Hugh?"
</p>

<p>
"Often.  I've lain awake at nights thinking
about it, till sometimes I got so wide awake that
I had to get up and walk about and hang out of
the window, and sometimes I got so drugged
with my own thoughts that I went to sleep
thinking it was really happening."
</p>

<p>
"It's queer that you should love me so much,
Hugh, but I should die at once if you didn't."
</p>

<p>
The door opened, and a housemaid came in to
see to the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Go away, Mary," said Jessica, dreamily.
"We've only got ten minutes together; we can't
be interrupted."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so sorry, Miss Jessica," said Mary.  "I'll
see that nobody else disturbs you.  The fire can
wait."
</p>

<p>
She closed the door very softly, and went
downstairs to inform the other servants that the
sitting-room fire could await Miss Jessica's
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't it be appalling, Hugh, if we really
had only ten minutes and then you had to leave
me to go to China or some place."
</p>

<p>
"Awful!" said Hugh shortly, an expression
of pain on his face.
</p>

<p>
"But we needn't worry," Jessica consoled him.
"We've got all the time there is, haven't we?"
</p>

<p>
"Darling, we'll need it; I can't ever have
enough of you."
</p>

<p>
Jessica suddenly shivered.
</p>

<p>
"Are you cold, my sweet?" he asked
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit.  I suddenly thought of something."
</p>

<p>
Jessica fell silent.
</p>

<p>
"What did you think of to make you shudder
like that?  Tell me, darling."
</p>

<p>
Hugh held her more closely, but Jessica did
not answer for a moment, and when she did, she
spoke jerkily and nervously.
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking of that terrifying play
'Hassan.'  Do you remember how the two lovers
could either be free and never see each other
again, or else have one night together and then
die in torture?  I often think of that and I know
I should choose to have the night with you even
if I did have to be tortured, but still it does
frighten me."
</p>

<p>
"Darling, don't think of it.  We're fools to sit
and frighten each other with idiotic impossibilities.
Besides, every minute of to-day belongs to
me and I insist on you being happy."
</p>

<p>
Hugh spoke gaily, but as he looked down at
Jessica, he saw two tears hanging on her eyelashes.
</p>

<p>
"Jessica, dear," he said.  "Nothing is really
wrong, is it?  You haven't changed your mind
about marrying me, have you?"
</p>

<p>
Jessica held him convulsively, and smiled,
though her tears fell.
</p>

<p>
"No, of course not," she said.  "Nothing is
wrong.  I'm just a damned fool.  I love you so
and I get into dreadful panics about losing you
and not having you any more."
</p>

<p>
"I'll keep you safe, I promise," Hugh spoke
earnestly.  "I'll always take care of you, my only
love."
</p>

<p>
"I know you will, Hugh.  It's all right really;
I do feel safe with you.  Sometimes I lose my
nerve, that's all, and the other day Mother said
something about not putting all my eggs in one
basket."
</p>

<p>
"How silly."  Hugh laughed scornfully.
"What would be the use of scattering them
about in dozens of baskets.  Besides your Mother
did it herself, and very successfully too; she
adores your father."
</p>

<p>
Jessica sprang to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hugh," she exclaimed conscience-stricken.
"I've never seen Daddy all day, and I
know he'll be feeling utterly miserable about
losing me.  I must go to him at once."
</p>

<p>
"You're a vain creature; and anyhow, you
don't want to go dashing off this minute to look
for him.  I'll have to go soon and you can find
him then."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear, I suppose it's all right.  I'll wait
till you go."
</p>

<p>
Jessica sat down again, drew Hugh's arm
round her, and leaned back comfortably on his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not vain," she said.  "But Daddy really
is different.  He needs me quite badly just as I
need him, and often I feel guilty for marrying
you and leaving him."
</p>

<p>
"But, darling, I need you frightfully.  Honestly
I need you more than your father.  I know
he loves you, but, my dear, I do more than that;
I couldn't live without you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad," said Jessica.  "We're both in the
same boat then."
</p>

<p>
Forgetting to care about her complexion she
turned her face to Hugh to be kissed.  As Drusilla
came in they broke apart from each other, but
Jessica still kept her arms linked around Hugh's
neck.
</p>

<p>
"Must he go now?" she asked, vaguely.  "How
terribly cruel."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm afraid he must," said Drusilla.  "Its
nearly twelve and it will take you all that time to
bathe and dress and have some sort of meal.  But
it isn't really so very cruel you know, Jessica,
you've only got to wait about three hours till
you have him for good."
</p>

<p>
"It is cruel," Jessica persisted wildly.  "He'll
never have me again as Jessica Deane.  It will all
be quite different and it's been so lovely up till
now."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm longing for the end of Jessica
Deane," said Hugh laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Don't laugh at me; you can't be certain that
everything will be all right; don't laugh at me,"
said Jessica brokenly.
</p>

<p>
Hugh took her in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"My darling," he said soberly.  "I am certain
that everything will be all right.  It won't be any
different, only a million times better."
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure, Hugh?  Are you really sure?"
</p>

<p>
"I promise you I am.  Listen, sweet, I must go
now and Drusilla will help you to dress and look
after you, won't you, Drusilla?"  He looked
appealingly over Jessica's head.  "And I'll be
waiting for you when you come up the aisle with
your father, and you must tip me a little wink
when you get to me just to show me you're all
right."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, darling, of course I'm all right," said
Jessica happily.  "I am, Drusilla, aren't I?
I'm only a little crazed to-day, it's all so queer
and lovely.  I don't know what got me, I just
suddenly felt sad for a minute.  I think it was
thinking about Daddy, but I'll go and comfort
him a little when you've gone.  Goodbye, my own
dear love."
</p>

<p>
"I believe this is the only time I've ever said
good-bye to you without getting an actual physical
pain in the pit of my stomach."
</p>

<p>
"My dears," interrupted Drusilla, still waiting
in the doorway, "I don't want to interrupt
you, but&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"All right, Drusilla, I've gone; better do it
quickly."
</p>

<p>
Hugh kissed Jessica, ran downstairs and in a
moment the slam of the front door echoed
through the house.
</p>

<p>
Jessica stood still where he had left her,
staring vacantly after him.
</p>

<p>
"Jessica, are you asleep?" Drusilla asked her.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head and her eyes lightened.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not.  I'm awake and blissfully happy.
Tell me, shall I go and talk to Daddy now, or
have my bath first?  I haven't seen him all morning."
</p>

<p>
"I honestly think you ought to start dressing
first.  Daddy's all right.  He is prowling round
the house with everyone falling over him and
carrying dishes and things round him."
</p>

<p>
"Poor darling," said Jessica tenderly.  "Don't
let me have too hot a bath," she warned Drusilla
on the way upstairs.  "I must be careful not to let
my hair go limp."
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
IV
</p>

<p>
Dressing was pure delight.  Jessica put on for
the second time that day the yellow silk vest, the
long gold silk stockings, and the narrow gold
shoes, but added, this time, yellow silk knickers
and a pair of gold garters.
</p>

<p>
As she stepped back to look at herself before
putting on her frock, she said earnestly: "I do
hope Hugh will like my shape."
</p>

<p>
"But surely you know he does," said Drusilla
reassuring.  "He thinks you're lovely and you are
rather to-day."
</p>

<p>
"But he's never seen me stark," said Jessica
simply.  "It makes a difference.  I think I'm too
boyish-looking.  I'd like to be frightfully
feminine just for once."
</p>

<p>
"But you are in that frock.  It really is
charming.  Do let me get you into it now.  I
ought to go and dress now myself.  And here's
Mother."
</p>

<p>
"I'm all ready, darling," said Mrs. Deane.  "I
just came to help to finish you off.  Where's
Marchmont?"
</p>

<p>
"We sent her away because Drusilla was helping
me and I hate a crowd."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll slip your frock on for you, my
dear, but Marchmont had better arrange the veil,
I think."
</p>

<p>
"You do look nice, Mother, in all your elegance.
Is Daddy dressed too?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not yet; he's fussing a little."
</p>

<p>
"Oh Mummy, I must see him.  Please go and
tell him to come up."
</p>

<p>
"It will do just as well when you're dressed,
darling; you really must get on."
</p>

<p>
Jessica suddenly balked.
</p>

<p>
"I can't," she said.  "I really can't put my frock
on till I see Daddy.  It's an inhibition."
</p>

<p>
She giggled softly, and Mrs. Deane looked
at her in consternation as she sat down, still in
her yellow underclothes and twisted her feet,
like a child, round the legs of the chair.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest Jessica," she remonstrated.  "You
must try to be calm or you will make us all
nervous and unhappy."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, darling, I'm sorry," said Jessica,
instantly penitent.  "Look, I'll get dressed as good
as gold while you call Daddy."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke she struggled into her frock and
when Mrs. Deane came back, followed by Mr. Deane,
she ran to her father, trailing her train
across the bedroom floor.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," she said, "I've been wanting you
all morning.  I've been shut in by a conspiracy of
women.  Quite shocking; I feel as if I were in a
harem."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you seemed to have a good long time
with Hugh, I noticed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh that was only a minute.  Besides he came
on business with two presents.  Do I look nice?"
</p>

<p>
Jessica stepped back as she asked the question
and trod on her train.  There was a little
ripping sound as it tore away from one shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jessica, you've torn it.  I knew perfectly
well something would happen if you got so
excited.  Now I'll have to fetch Marchmont to
mend it."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Deane hurried away, and Mr. Deane
looked guiltily at Jessica.
</p>

<p>
"I think I'd better get out of this," he said.
"It's no place for me.  But just tell me, my dear,
you're quite happy, aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am, Daddy; how do you mean
exactly?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Deane cleared his throat nervously.
"I don't mean anything, Jessica.  Only if you
have any doubts or worries or anything, far
better call it off now, than go on with it."
</p>

<p>
He spoke fiercely, and with his eyes averted.
Heedless of her already torn frock Jessica flung
her arms round his neck.
</p>

<p>
"You're too sweet, darling," she said.  "I know
it would kill you to have your daughter jib at
the altar.  It really is sweet of you to suggest it.
But I'm all right, Daddy.  For once in my life
I'm quite sure, with no after-thought and no
terrors.  Hugh's the proper person for me to
belong to.  You'd better go now; they're coming to
mend me."
</p>

<p>
She stood still and quiet while the train was
readjusted, and Mrs. Deane, looking at the
steady glow of colour in her cheeks, felt relieved
and contented.  It seemed only a moment till
Drusilla came back wearing her gold bridesmaid's
dress with a heavy medi√¶val green girdle
falling in two strands to the ground.  She was
carrying a bouquet of tawny chrysanthemums
and a sheaf of faintly green speckled orchids
for Jessica.
</p>

<p>
"Here's your exotic bouquet, my child," she
said.  "And I think it's far too macabre for a
bride, but I suppose you like it.  And here are
the chicken sandwiches," she added as a maid
entered with a tray.
</p>

<p>
Another moment for eating the sandwiches,
and then a kiss from her mother, a kiss from
Drusilla, and they were gone to Jessica's
wedding, leaving the house very still, as if all
life in it were suspended.
</p>

<p>
Jessica came slowly downstairs to the drawing-room
to find her father.  He was waiting for
her at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Come in and sit down," he advised, "We
ought to give them fully five minutes start.  That
will be enough."
</p>

<p>
He looked anxiously at his watch and appraisingly
at Jessica.
</p>

<p>
"Not nervous, are you dear?  You look very
nice indeed, and there's nothing to be nervous
about; it's quite plain sailing now."
</p>

<p>
He patted her hand fussily, and pulled out
his watch again.  Jessica smiled.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not," she said.  "Not a scrap.  But
you are.  You've looked at your watch twice in
the last minute."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense; I'm not at all nervous.  I've done
all this before.  It's not so very long since I gave
Marjorie away, you know."
</p>

<p>
"But that was different, wasn't it, Daddy?"
Jessica insinuated softly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Deane cleared his throat.
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course, Marjorie was much older
and then she had been engaged a long time and&mdash;yes,
well, it was a little different," he finished
lamely.
</p>

<p>
"You know quite well what I meant, darling;
you're just being evasive.  I meant we were
rather special, you and I."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Jessica, we must be sensible," Mr. Deane
looked at his watch.  "It's time we were
off; we must allow a little extra in case of a
block.  Come along, dear, and be careful with
your train.  Your Mother told me to see you
didn't disarrange yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Kiss me once, Daddy, before we go."
</p>

<p>
"Now be sensible, my dear.  Your Mother said
I wasn't to let you get excited."
</p>

<p>
"Darling, stop quoting Mother at me," said
Jessica as she kissed her father and took his arm
to go downstairs.
</p>

<p>
"Don't let your train touch the step," he adjured
her.  "There, that's all right."  He stepped
into the car.
</p>

<p>
"Good wishes, Miss Jessica," said the
parlourmaid, smiling broadly, as she shut the door
and the car started for the church.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh's made all the arrangements about
tickets and so forth, hasn't he?" asked Mr. Deane.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think so, Daddy; he's very competent."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I gave your Mother twenty pounds
for you, my dear.  Better have some ready
money when you're travelling.  She said she
would put it in the purse you were taking away
with you."
</p>

<p>
"That was kind of you.  Thank you, darling.
I know Hugh is taking heaps of money, but it's
useful to have a little of my own."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, quite; that was what I thought.  Surely
the car is going very slowly; we must not be
late."  He looked at his watch again and added,
"No, it's all right, still seven minutes to the
half-hour and we're nearly there."
</p>

<p>
Jessica pressed his hand gently.
</p>

<p>
"Your Mother will miss you," said Mr. Deane
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Not half as much as you will, Daddy.  And
I'll miss you, too.  I wish you could come with
me.  Will you write to me to-morrow, or the
next day, or very soon anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, I will; yes, certainly.  But you
mustn't worry.  Just take things easily; everything
is perfectly satisfactory and straightforward."
</p>

<p>
"I'm looking forward to the church bit of it,
but not to the reception so much.  But truly,
I'm not fussed, Daddy."
</p>

<p>
"That's right.  There's no need to be.  Hugh's
a good boy; if he weren't I'd never have allowed
it."
</p>

<p>
"Sweetheart, you couldn't have stopped it,
not possibly; nothing could."
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear, you must be wise, and don't
exaggerate.  Here we are.  Be very careful getting
out; your Mother said you might get your train
muddy just here."
</p>

<p>
As Jessica trailed the long gold train up
the red carpet, she smiled at the eager, peering
faces on either side and when a hoarse voice at
the top said "Good luck, Miss," she half turned
and said, "Thank you, indeed," in her usual clear
steady voice.
</p>

<p>
A blur of massed faces swam before her eyes
as she peeped into the church from the porch,
while her two small pages caught up the loops
of her train, and the bridesmaids formed
themselves into a procession.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Jessica, are you ready?" whispered
Mr. Deane urgently, as the organ burst out into
a hymn, and the congregation stood up.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, darling, let's start.  I can't see Hugh
from here."
</p>

<p>
She walked slowly up the long aisle, her face
uncovered, her head not bent in the conventional
attitude, a half-smile of anticipation on
her lips.
</p>

<p>
Then Hugh's face, a deep voice hurrying
through the prescribed service, her father
leaving her to slip into a pew, her own voice more
distinct than usual, and Hugh's less distinct, a
confused interlude of kisses and congratulations
in the vestry, and once more she was in the car,
this time with Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"My darling," he said quietly.  "My lovely,
darling Jessica."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad now that I'm Jessica Greene because
I love you so."
</p>

<p>
"Only a little minute, my sweet, and then
we'll get away from these people and be by
ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind them.  They're all wondering
if we'll be happy and if you'll be good to me,
and thinking back to their own wedding-days
and having lumps in their throats."
</p>

<p>
"I should certainly have a lump in my throat
if I were old and dull and came to your
wedding, Jessica.  You'll never know how
beautiful you looked coming to me."
</p>

<p>
They sat blissfully silent till the car stopped,
and the parlourmaid was again at the door
smiling brightly as she said:
</p>

<p>
"Congratulations, Mrs. Greene, please, and
to you, too, Sir."
</p>

<p>
Jessica laughed.
</p>

<p>
"It does sound funny," she said.  "Thank you,
Morgan.  I suppose we ought to hurry upstairs
and get ready in the drawing-room.  Come
along, Hugh; the mob may be on us at any
moment."
</p>

<p>
Three quarters of an hour later after more
congratulations, a steady hum of conversation,
and an exhausting atmosphere of heat, feathers
and flowers, Jessica found herself being
shepherded up to her room by Drusilla.
</p>

<p>
"It all went beautifully," said Drusilla.
"Really Jessica, you looked as nice as you wanted
to."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Drusilla, I am so glad it's over, and yet
I enjoyed every single minute, and I would like
to do it all again, but of course I can't, ever.
What a depressing thought."
</p>

<p>
"You silly little thing.  Why be depressed
because you can't have a second wedding before
you've even finished your first.  Here, have some
tea.  Mother said you must while you were
changing."
</p>

<p>
"The whole of to-day has been nothing but
eating queer foods at queer times, and saying
thank you and dressing and undressing.  I'm
sorry to take my frock off and leave it behind."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind.  We'll have the neck cut a little
lower while you're away and you can wear it for
your first proper dinner-party when you come
home."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it odd that I'm not coming home, Drusilla.
I mean that I'm going to another house
with Hugh."
</p>

<p>
"It's beastly.  I'll probably get married
myself now."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you'd better.  It would be such
a blow for the two poor dear lambs."
</p>

<p>
"Jessica, what cheek!  Do you mean that I'm
to be an elderly spinster just so that you can
leave the parents with a clear conscience."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not leaving them with a clear conscience.
I wish I were, but I feel awful about Daddy."
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry.  He loves Hugh you know.
We're bound to feel damnably flat when the
people go and we realise we're alone, but we'll
get over it all right."
</p>

<p>
"Please don't get over it entirely, Drusilla.  I
would like to know you were missing me.  Oh,
Marjorie, come in."
</p>

<p>
Marjorie Sellars kissed Jessica perfunctorily.
"Well, it was all very nice," she said.  "I
must say I liked all that gold much better than
I expected to.  But Mrs. Greene says she would
have preferred a white wedding so I'm afraid
you've put your foot in it, Jessica."
</p>

<p>
"What nonsense," said Drusilla irritably.  "It
doesn't matter a scrap whether she approved
or not."
</p>

<p>
"I don't really mind at all."  Jessica's voice
was carefree.  "She doesn't know much about
clothes, so I don't mind and Lavinia who does
know, liked it awfully."
</p>

<p>
"Lavinia looked very nice, I thought," said
Marjorie.  "But your other sister-in-law, Helen,
is very plain, isn't she?"
</p>

<p>
Jessica and Drusilla gasped.
</p>

<p>
"You're mad, Marjorie," said Jessica quietly.
"You must surely see that she's definitely
attractive?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all; I always think red hair is a little
vulgar," said Marjorie briskly.  "But surely it's
time you were dressed, isn't it?  When's your
train?"
</p>

<p>
"Not till 4.45, I think, and I'm just going to
dress."
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door and Lavinia
came in.
</p>

<p>
"I won't stay," she began, "I'm sure you don't
want me, now, but I had to come and tell you
how nicely it all went.  You looked lovely,
Jessica dear."
</p>

<p>
Jessica grasped her hand.
</p>

<p>
"How nice you are, Lavinia," she said.  "Not
a bit like a sister-in-law.  Did you really like it?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I did, immensely; so did everyone."
</p>

<p>
Another knock heralded the entrance of the
five grown-up bridesmaids who filled the room
with their shining frocks and huge bouquets.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord," said one, "she hasn't begun to
dress yet.  I say, you must hurry, Jessica; people
are all lining up the stairs to see you come down,
but you'll never get through the mob."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I shan't hurry down, anyhow," said
Jessica serenely, pulling off her frock.  "And I
won't be a minute, now, I haven't got to change
my underclothes."
</p>

<p>
"Here are your stockings and shoes, darling,"
said Drusilla, and Lavinia snatched a shoe out of
her hand with a little exclamation of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I do like these lizards.  They're beautifully
marked."
</p>

<p>
"Here, do let me put it on," said Jessica.  "And
tell me, do you think it will matter if I stop on
the way down to say goodbye to anyone I specially
like.  I do want to have a word with Daddy
in the hall."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to rush down," said another of
the bridesmaids, "as if you were overwhelmed
with maidenly confusion and escaping from the
plaudits of the crowd."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't," said Jessica in a muffled voice as
she drew her frock over her head.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think it will look nice if she goes
slowly," commented a third.  "And it's a lovely
going-away frock."
</p>

<p>
"Now give me my hat," said Jessica, just as
two quiet knocks sounded on the door.  Her face
flamed.  "There's Hugh," she said.  "All go away
now; I'll be down in a minute.  Good bye, my
dears, and thank you all for being my bridesmaids."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye and good luck, Jessica," said Marjorie,
crisply, following the shining flock.
"Good-bye, Jessica, dear, have a lovely
honeymoon," said Lavinia, and kissed Hugh as he
stood embarrassed in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go, Drusilla; I haven't said good-bye
to you."
</p>

<p>
Jessica's mouth trembled, but as Hugh came
over to her, she smiled at him and forgot the
pain of parting with Drusilla.
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready," she said.  "Shall we go now,
Hugh?  Take my hand and let's go slowly.  I
hate the way they push and run sometimes."
</p>

<p>
Drusilla went in front to clear a passage, and
Hugh and Jessica followed slowly down, saying:
"Good-bye, Good-bye&mdash;Thank you&mdash;It's been
lovely&mdash;Good-bye&mdash;Yes, we've really enjoyed it
ourselves&mdash;Good-bye and thank you."
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Rodney Greene were standing
on the first landing.  Jessica stopped to kiss them.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," she said.  "I'll keep Hugh
happy," and went on downstairs.
</p>

<p>
When she met Mrs. Deane a little lower down
the pause was longer.
</p>

<p>
"Is Daddy at the front door?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, darling, he's waiting for you."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Mother; write to me lots and
don't be depressed."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I won't, dear child.  Good-bye,
Hugh; take care of her."
</p>

<p>
Another kiss and they started down again.
The hall was crowded but Drusilla forged
steadily on in front and suddenly Jessica saw her
father on the top step.  Dropping Hugh's hand
she ran to him and clung round his neck.
</p>

<p>
"I hate leaving you.  I wish you could come
too," she whispered.  "Keep on thinking of me
all the time, Daddy."
</p>

<p>
"Be happy," said Mr. Deane.  "Have a happy
time and don't bother about us.  We'll miss you,
but we'll manage all right.  Where's Hugh got
to?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm here, sir," Hugh answered happily,
elbowing his friends to one side and gaining a
foothold on the top step.  "Good-bye, and thank
you.  I'll take care of Jessica."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Hugh; you're all right.  And now
good-bye, my darling girl."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Deane helped her into the car, and Hugh
jumped in beside her, but just before they
started Jessica leaned out of the window and
kissed her father again.
</p>

<p>
"I do love you, Daddy," she said.  "And I am
so happy."
</p>

<p>
"Splendid," said Mr. Deane, stoutly.  "Splendid.
Good luck to you both."
</p>

<p>
He stood on the kerb as the car moved away,
the steps behind him crowded with waving
guests, and then turned and went smiling into
the house, answering questions, laughing and
joking.  But he was conscious of a keen and biting
pain when he remembered that the first nineteen
years of Jessica's life had gone like a leaf before
the wind, and at their next meeting she would
be no longer Jessica, daughter of Anthony
Deane, but Jessica, wife of Hugh Beckett
Greene.

<p>
On the morning of her dinner party for the five
other Mrs. Greenes, Mrs. Rodney Greene
indulged in a spate of telephone calls.  Her first
one, to Lavinia, was in the nature of an appeal
for help.
</p>

<p>
"Lavinia dear," she began as soon as she got
through, "I want you to help me a little to-night.
It's too bad that Martin can't come; we're
very disappointed that he won't be back till
to-morrow but of course business must come first."
</p>

<p>
"He's very sorry too, but he simply can't help
it."
</p>

<p>
"No, I quite understand.  But about to-night,
will you be rather specially attentive to Aunt
Dora?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh Mother, I'm not very good with her."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!  She's quite fond of you in her
own way, and you know she feels a little hurt
that Helen has never taken any trouble about
her, and now she is annoyed by something that
happened at Jessica's wedding, so you must just
step into the breach, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"I know what happened at the wedding.  She
came late and got put into a back seat."
</p>

<p>
Lavinia's laugh rang clearly into the telephone,
but Mrs. Rodney frowned anxiously as
she answered: "Well, whatever it was I don't
want it to crop up to-night, and if you'll just sit
beside her after dinner and see that she doesn't
feel neglected I'm sure everything will be quite
all right."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Mother, I'll try, but I don't think
it will be very easy."
</p>

<p>
"My dear child, how absurd you are.  Everything
will be perfectly easy and smooth.  It
ought to be a very pleasant little party.  Tell me,
what frock are you wearing?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't really thought.  My new black I expect."
</p>

<p>
"Oh not black, dear.  Don't you think yourself
black is rather a pity?"
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.
</p>

<p>
"What did you say, dear?" asked Mrs. Rodney.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't say anything, Mother."  Lavinia's
voice sounded annoyed.
</p>

<p>
"Darling, surely you don't mind my just
suggesting one of your pretty pale frocks rather
than a black one?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite know what you mean by black
being 'rather a pity'."
</p>

<p>
"It's only that I want you to look your best,
you silly child, and a pale colour is so much
younger and more gay.  Besides, I'll be wearing
black.  Now don't forget Aunt Dora, will you,
and remember that dinner is at quarter to eight.
Your Grannie doesn't like it later.  Good-bye till
this evening."
</p>

<p>
She rang off, and sat at her desk for a moment,
looking faintly disturbed, before putting on a
call to Jessica.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, who's there?" asked a brusque voice.
</p>

<p>
"Can I speak to Mrs. Hugh please?  Mrs. Rodney
speaking."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know where Mrs. Greene is, but I'll
look for her if you'll wait a minute.  Who did
you say it was?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Mrs. Rodney Greene to speak to Mrs. Hugh
if you please."
</p>

<p>
Edith spoke icily with an accent of rebuke, but
the voice replied quite undaunted.
</p>

<p>
"Well hold on then, I'll look for her."
</p>

<p>
There was a long wait.  Edith sat holding the
receiver jotting down items on her shopping
list, until ultimately she heard Jessica's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, is that you, Mrs. Greene?"
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Jessica.  I hope everything is
all right with you?  I just wanted a word with
you about to-night.  You're wearing your
wedding frock of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do you want me to?  I meant to wear my
yellow georgette.  I thought the wedding frock
would be too dressed up just for a family
party."
</p>

<p>
"I hardly think so, Jessica.  After all the
dinner is for you, and I think it would be a nice
little courtesy to wear your gold tissue."
</p>

<p>
"Is the party really for me?  How awful!"
</p>

<p>
This time it was Mrs. Rodney who maintained
a silence of sheer annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean 'awful' of course, I only mean
rather frightening."
</p>

<p>
Jessica's voice was anxious as if she were
conscious of having offended, but Mrs. Rodney
replied briskly and coldly:
</p>

<p>
"There's no need to be frightened.  It's very
foolish of you.  We only want to welcome you
into the family."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much; of course I'll wear
my gold."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll see you this evening then and
don't be late.  Grannie likes dinner to be very
punctual.  By the way, Jessica, you really must
train your maid to answer the telephone properly."
</p>

<p>
A faint gasp fluttered along the wire.  "Oh
must I?  I don't know how to."
</p>

<p>
"It's perfectly easy.  You've only got to tell
her exactly what to say when she takes the
receiver off, and incidentally you might remind
her to call you Mrs. Hugh, there are too many
of us all to be Mrs. Greenes."
</p>

<p>
"I'll try, but it's terribly difficult.  She is so
much older and more severe than I am."
</p>

<p>
"I see I'll have to take you in hand a little
my dear, but never mind now.  Good-bye till
to-night."
</p>

<p>
The faintly perturbed frown was still on
Mrs. Rodney's face as she rang up Helen, and it
deepened when a polite voice answered her
request to speak to Mrs. Geoffrey.  "I'm sorry,
Madam, but Mrs. Geoffrey is engaged in her
studio, and gave orders that she wasn't to be
disturbed before eleven."
</p>

<p>
"But it's Mrs. Rodney Greene speaking."
</p>

<p>
"Could you ring up again in about half an
hour, Madam, or shall I ask Mrs. Geoffrey to
ring you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'll leave it now."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you Madam."  The polite voice died
away, and Mrs. Rodney petulantly pushed the
telephone aside as her husband came into the
room.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing wrong, Edith, I hope?" he asked,
noticing her look of irritation.
</p>

<p>
"No, nothing, thank you, dear.  Only sometimes
I get a little cross with all the children's
airs and graces."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't let them worry you.  You've got
enough to do without bothering over them.  The
car's here and I'm just starting to fetch Mother.
We ought to be back in good time for lunch,
and by the way dear, do you think we ought to
send the car for Dora to-night?"
</p>

<p>
Edith raised her eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"I've arranged to do that of course," she said
in a slightly pained voice, "I'm just going to
ring up Dora and let her know."
</p>

<p>
"Splendid; that's quite all right.  Well I must
be off now.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Rodney.  Be sure the warm rug is
in the car for your Mother."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Rodney sat staring out of the window
until the sound of the front door being shut
disturbed her thoughts.  Then she smoothed her
hair, sat very upright in her chair, pulled the
telephone once again towards her, and rang up
Mrs. Edwin.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, who are you?" she heard her sister-in-law
ask.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Dora.  It's Edith speaking.
How are you?"
</p>

<p>
Her voice was unusually cordial, as if she
hoped to establish a cheerful atmosphere even
through the awkward medium of the telephone
where her deliberately bright smile
was lost.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not feeling very well thank you, Edith.
This week is always a particularly trying one for
me you know, and the strain seems to be telling
on me more than usual this year."
</p>

<p>
"What do you say?"
</p>

<p>
"I say the strain is telling on me more
than usual this year.  What a bad connection
this is."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, isn't it?  I'm so sorry, but what did
you say you were telling me?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean, Edith.  Hullo,
are you there?  This is a disgraceful connection.  I
only said I was feeling the strain of this week
very badly."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! yes of course, I do sympathise with you,
Dora.  It's a sad time for you I know.  I just
wanted a word with you about to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Really, Edith, I don't know that I shall be
able to face a party to-night."
</p>

<p>
"What do you say?"
</p>

<p>
"I said that I didn't really know whether I
would be able to come to-night or not."
</p>

<p>
"Oh that's better now.  I can hear you quite
clearly.  Well I do hope you'll manage to-night.
We'll all be so disappointed if you can't.  The
children are looking forward to seeing you, and
I know Grannie and Aunt Sarah are counting
on it too."
</p>

<p>
"I don't flatter myself that the children, as
you call them, care one way or the other about
me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  that's rubbish, Dora.  We all hope you
will come.  Now, may I send the car for
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't trouble, thank you very much.  It is
not the lack of a car that's preventing me
coming."
</p>

<p>
"No of course not, I quite understand.  But I
really rang up just to offer you the car.  Dinner is
a little early you see because of the old ladies,
and I thought it might be a convenience."
</p>

<p>
"Very kind of you I'm sure.  But as it happens
I've made my own arrangements.  My friend
Mrs. Blythe asked me several days ago to use
her car both for going and coming."
</p>

<p>
"That's very nice then.  I'm so glad you feel
able to come after all."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know that I do really.  I haven't
felt quite myself since Jessica's wedding.  The
church was very draughty near the door and I
got badly chilled."
</p>

<p>
"That's too bad.  However, we will expect
you to-night; it will be very nice to see you.
Good-bye till then."
</p>

<p>
"What, Edith?"
</p>

<p>
"I said we would expect you to-night at
quarter to eight.  Good-bye for the present."
</p>

<p>
"But Edith, hullo Edith, are you still there?
I was just explaining that I don't feel well
enough to come."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so sorry, the telephone is really intolerable
to-day, I didn't catch what you said."
</p>

<p>
"I said I wasn't feeling quite myself."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll all be most disappointed, Dora,
but of course if you don't feel well enough,
you're much wiser to stay at home."
</p>

<p>
"But I'd be sorry to disappoint you all.  As I
said before, it's a pity you chose this date for
your party, but still, I must make the effort
and come, only don't expect me to be very
bright."
</p>

<p>
"How nice of you; that really is delightful."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Rodney tried to infuse a note of warmth
into her voice, but as she heard Mrs. Edwin's
voice beginning plaintively "Of course I must
say&mdash;-" she added loudly and hurriedly,
</p>

<p>
"Well, au revoir, and I'm sure you'll be none
the worse of it," and rang off.
</p>

<p>
Exasperated and depressed she got up and
walked up and down the room in a state of
uncharacteristic agitation.  She was beset by minor
difficulties: Lavinia's annoyance at the merest
hint of what to wear; Jessica unable to manage
her servant, in need of help and guidance, but
quite probably ready to resent both; Dora in her
most tiresome and difficult mood.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Rodney sighed impatiently and rang
the bell.  When the butler appeared she sat
down again at her desk, took up a list and ran
through it.
</p>

<p>
"About dinner to-night, there are one or two
things to arrange.  First of all, Rayner, I want
you to be on the upper landing to show everyone
into the drawing-room.  Evans must open the
front door, but I specially want you to announce
everyone in full.  Mrs. Greene is staying in the
house but I want her announced too, and be
careful just to call her Mrs. Greene, and to give
the others their full names.  You know Mrs. Hugh
Greene of course, but young Mr. Hugh
and his wife must be announced as Mr. and
Mrs. Hugh Beckett Greene."
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand, Madam.  There will be
Mrs. Greene, Mrs. Hugh Greene, Mrs. Edwin
Greene, Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Greene and
Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Beckett Greene."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's right.  I'll order flowers for the
table when I'm out this morning, and I want
the Lowestoft service and the Wedgwood fruit
plates of course.  It's a family dinner, but in a
way it's a celebration."
</p>

<p>
She smiled at Rayner, confident of his interest
in everything pertaining to the family.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see to everything myself, Madam," he
assured her.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Greene has told you what champagne
to bring up?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes Madam, but young Mrs. Hugh never
takes champagne.  Should I open a bottle of
Chablis for her?"
</p>

<p>
"No, certainly not.  She must take a little
to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Madam.  Cook desired me to ask
you if you would care for the ice pudding to be
shaped like a bell and garnished with orange
blossom.  She can make a nice sugar wreath to
decorate the dish."
</p>

<p>
"What a good idea.  Yes, tell cook that will
be very nice, and that it is very good of
her to have thought out a little compliment
for Miss Jessica.  I think that's all, thank
you."
</p>

<p>
An expression of satisfaction had chased away
her frown.  She was pleased that the servants at
least should throw themselves so keenly into a
family affair, even though the fact of their
doing so sharpened her annoyance at her
children's aloof unresponsiveness.
</p>

<p>
The telephone rang shrilly.  Probably Dora,
she thought, and took off the receiver
reluctantly, but it was Helen's voice that said:
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Mrs. Greene, is that you?  Margaret
told me you'd rung up while I was working.  I'm
sorry she didn't interrupt me; she ought to have
known I'd speak to you to-day."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Rodney was mollified by the flattering
implication in Helen's words but she hoped for
a further confirmation when she answered
provocatively:
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, my dear.  It was a little
annoying of course, but still you mustn't make
an exception of me."
</p>

<p>
Helen's reply was casual but final.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't ordinarily.  But to-day is rather
special, isn't it."
</p>

<p>
Piqued as she was at not being given preferential
treatment, Mrs. Rodney was so delighted
with Helen for realising the importance of the
occasion, that she decided to ignore the other
point in the meantime.  It could always be
brought up later.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad you think so, dear," she said
warmly.  "It certainly is a special occasion from
my point of view.  Tell me, what are you
thinking of wearing?"
</p>

<p>
"My silver and white brocade.  It's much the
grandest frock I've got, so what could be more
suitable?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Rodney wondered momentarily if there
was a faint note of mockery in Helen's
tones, but decided that it must be due to
the telephone.
</p>

<p>
"That's delightful.  You always look so nice
in it.  And Helen dear, don't be late at all, will
you.  It worries Grannie if dinner is a minute
later than quarter to eight."
</p>

<p>
"No, we won't be late I promise.  I'll let
Geoffrey drive the car."
</p>

<p>
"Do, Helen, I'm sure it's wiser."
</p>

<p>
"Was there anything else you wanted, Mrs. Greene?"
</p>

<p>
"No, nothing.  I only thought I'd remind you
about the hour."
</p>

<p>
"Well, good-bye Mrs. Greene, and good luck
with your stage managing.  I hope the
production will be good."
</p>

<p>
"Helen, hullo Helen, don't go yet.  Tell me
what you mean, dear?"
</p>

<p>
Again a faint doubt of Helen's good faith
crossed Mrs. Rodney's mind, but she was
reassured by Helen's calm explanation.
</p>

<p>
"I mean about to-night.  You'll have to stage
manage the whole affair, and I'm sure it will go
beautifully.  I propose to enjoy myself
enormously as one of the humbler members of the
caste."
</p>

<p>
"Oh I see," Mrs. Rodney resolutely stilled
her doubts, and went on playfully: "Of course a
good hostess always has to stage manage a little,
and even more in a family party.  Good-bye,
dear child, till this evening, and don't be
late."
</p>

<p>
Going upstairs to put on her hat Edith
Greene's mind was busy over the choice of
flowers for the table.  White flowers seemed to
her the most ceremonial but she rejected
chrysanthemums as being too clumsy and lilies of the
valley as being reminiscent of the sick room.  I
must strike the right note with my flowers, she
thought.  I want the whole thing to be sufficiently
important.  Lilies, of course, Madonna lilies, so
suitable both for old Mrs. Greene and Jessica;
they would be exactly right.
</p>

<p>
Her face cleared and she went briskly out,
confident that the scene was set for the
evening's play.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p class="t3">
II
</p>

<p>
It was only twenty-five to eight when Rayner
opened the door to Lavinia.
</p>

<p>
"You are early, Madam," he said as he took
her cloak, "I don't think anyone is down yet."
</p>

<p>
"I know I am; I wondered if there was a
chance of seeing Grannie before the others
arrived.  Do you suppose she will be down
soon?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know at all, but I can send Mary up
to tell her you are here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes do, Rayner; go and tell her now, I'll go
up to the drawing-room."
</p>

<p>
On the upper landing Lavinia stopped to look
at her reflection, tiny and faintly distorted, in a
small convex mirror that had delighted her as a
child.
</p>

<p>
She was wearing for the first time, in deference
to her Mother's wishes, a yellow velvet frock,
quite plain, very full skirted, and, in the fashion
of the moment, short in front but dipping almost
to the ground behind.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she took her wide skirt in either
hand, and curtsied very low to her own image.
The mirror was flooded with the yellow of her
frock, but as she rose and straightened herself
the small grotesque reflection was re-established.
</p>

<p>
The drawing-room was in darkness except for
the leaping firelight but she switched on the
small lamp beside the fire, and sat down thinking
dreamily how pretty it would be if a group of
ladies in long old-fashioned frocks were to
assemble there that night.
</p>

<p>
We would have to kiss Grannie's hand and
Mother's too I suppose, and Helen and Jessica
and I would curtsey very low to each other and
say "Sister," and "Your servant, Sister."  And
there would be so much swaying and rustling of
silks that it would seem like sixty Mrs. Greenes
instead of six.
</p>

<p>
She sighed as she looked forward to the evening
ahead.
</p>

<p>
Really it will be quite ordinary, she decided; a
little flutter of excitement as each one comes in
and then perfectly ordinary conversation.  Aunt
Sarah rather prim, and Grannie very crisp, and
Aunt Dora pretty doleful, and Mother managing
everything, and keeping us all in our proper
places.
</p>

<p>
She stood up, and leaning against the mantel-piece
looked round the shadowy room.  Everything
was orderly: the soft puce curtains hung
in beautifully symmetrical folds, a bowl of giant
chrysanthemums stood on a table, each petal
tightly curled, the firelight shone on a vivid
Chinese vase standing on a little lacquer cabinet
between the windows.
</p>

<p>
An air of stillness and expectation hung over
the room.
</p>

<p>
It's a lovely setting, Lavinia decided
suddenly.  After all there may be an atmosphere
about this evening.  Grannie is very old and
Jessica is very young, and nearly all the happiness
and unhappiness that lies in the years between
them is bound up with the Greene family.
Perhaps that will make Grannie younger and
Jessica older, so that they will become alike and
indistinguishable.
</p>

<p>
She shivered a little.  I'm glad I'm out of it,
she thought.  This family feeling frightens me.
I should hate to feel myself becoming akin to
Aunt Dora.
</p>

<p>
Rayner came into the room, switching on the
lights so that all the details of colour and form
suddenly sprang into being.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Greene will be down in a moment," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Lavinia absently.  "Rayner,
it's going to be very odd to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I hope not, Madam, I'm sure."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's bound to be odd; I shall feel like
the only human in a company of poor ghosts."
